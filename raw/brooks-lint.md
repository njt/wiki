Quick Start • The Six Decay Risks • What It Looks Like • Benchmark • Installation


"The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned."— Frederick Brooks,The Mythical Man-Month(1975)

**50 years later, Brooks was still right — and so were McConnell, Fowler, Martin, Hunt & Thomas, Evans, Ousterhout, Winters, Meszaros, Osherove, Feathers, and the Google Testing team.**

Most code quality tools count lines and cyclomatic complexity. **brooks-lint** goes deeper — it diagnoses your code against six decay risk dimensions synthesized from twelve classic engineering books, producing structured findings with book citations, severity labels, and concrete remedies every time.

For the full source-to-skill mapping, including exceptions and false-positive guards, see
`skills/_shared/source-coverage.md`.

Then just ask ("review this PR", "audit the architecture") — or run a command:

| Command | What it does | 
|---|---|
| `/brooks-review` | Review a PR or diff | 
| `/brooks-audit` | Audit architecture (+ Mermaid dependency graph) | 
| `/brooks-debt` | Prioritized tech-debt roadmap | 
| `/brooks-test` | Test-suite quality review |

brooks-lint evaluates your code across **six production-code decay risks** and **six test-suite decay risks** synthesized from twelve classic engineering books:

| Decay Risk | Diagnostic Question | Sources | 
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 Cognitive Overload | How much mental effort to understand this? | Code Complete, Refactoring, DDD, Philosophy of SD | 
| 🔗 Change Propagation | How many unrelated things break on one change? | Refactoring, Clean Architecture, Pragmatic, SE@Google | 
| 📋 Knowledge Duplication | Is the same decision expressed in multiple places? | Pragmatic, Refactoring, DDD | 
| 🌀 Accidental Complexity | Is the code more complex than the problem? | Refactoring, Code Complete, Brooks, Philosophy of SD | 
| 🏗️ Dependency Disorder | Do dependencies flow in a consistent direction? | Clean Architecture, Brooks, Pragmatic, SE@Google | 
| 🗺️ Domain Model Distortion | Does the code faithfully represent the domain? | DDD, Refactoring | 

Philosophy of SD =

A Philosophy of Software Design(Ousterhout) · SE@Google =Software Engineering at Google(Winters et al.)

Given this code:

```
class UserService:
    def update_profile(self, user_id, name, email, avatar_url):
        user = self.db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
        user['email'] = email
        ...
        if user['email'] != email:   # always False — silent bug
            self.smtp.send(...)
        points = user['login_count'] * 10 + 500
        self.db.execute(f"UPDATE loyalty SET points={points} WHERE user_id={user_id}")
```
brooks-lint produces:

**Health Score: 28/100**

*This method concentrates four unrelated business responsibilities into a single function, contains a logic bug that silently suppresses email change notifications, and is wide open to SQL injection.*

**Symptom:** `update_profile` performs profile field updates, email change notifications, loyalty points recalculation, and cache invalidation all in one method body.
**Source:** Fowler — *Refactoring* — Divergent Change; Hunt & Thomas — *The Pragmatic Programmer* — Orthogonality
**Consequence:** Any change to the loyalty formula risks breaking email notifications and vice versa. Every edit carries regression risk across four unrelated domains simultaneously.
**Remedy:** Extract `NotificationService`, `LoyaltyService`, and `UserCacheInvalidator`. `UserService.update_profile` should orchestrate by calling each — it should hold no implementation logic itself.

**Symptom:** `user['email'] = email` overwrites the old value before `if user['email'] != email` — the condition is always `False`. The notification is dead code.
**Source:** McConnell — *Code Complete* — Ch. 17: Unusual Control Structures
**Consequence:** Users are never notified when their email address changes. Silent data integrity failure — the system appears functional while violating a business rule.
**Remedy:** Capture `old_email = user['email']` before any mutation. Compare against `old_email`, not `user['email']`.

*(+ 6 more findings including SQL injection, dependency disorder, magic numbers)*

In Mode 2 (Architecture Audit), brooks-lint generates a **Mermaid dependency graph** at the top of the report. Modules are color-coded by severity: red = Critical findings, yellow = Warning, green = clean.

```
graph TD
    subgraph src/api
        AuthController
        UserController
    end
    subgraph src/domain
        UserService
        OrderService
    end
    subgraph src/infra
        Database
        EmailClient
    end
    AuthController --> UserService
    UserController --> UserService
    UserController --> OrderService
    OrderService --> UserService
    OrderService --> EmailClient
    UserService --> Database
    EmailClient -.->|circular| OrderService
    classDef critical fill:#ff6b6b,stroke:#c92a2a,color:#fff
    classDef warning fill:#ffd43b,stroke:#e67700
    classDef clean fill:#51cf66,stroke:#2b8a3e,color:#fff
    class OrderService,EmailClient critical
    class AuthController warning
    class UserService,UserController,Database clean
```
    The graph renders natively in GitHub, Notion, and other Markdown environments — no extra tools needed.

The Full Gallery has real brooks-lint output across Python, TypeScript, Go, and Java — including PR reviews, architecture audits with Mermaid dependency graphs, tech debt assessments, and test quality reviews.

New to the decay risks? The **Decay Risk Field Guide** explains all six — diagnostic question, signature symptoms, source books, and remedy for each.

Tested across 3 real-world scenarios (PR review, architecture audit, tech debt assessment):

| Criterion | brooks-lint | Claude alone | 
|---|---|---|
| Structured findings (Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% | 
| Book citations per finding | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% | 
| Severity labels (🔴/🟡/🟢) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% | 
| Health Score (0–100) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% | 
| Detects Change Propagation | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | 
| Overall pass rate | 94% | 16% | 

The gap isn't what Claude *can* find — it's what it *consistently* finds, with traceable evidence and actionable remedies every time.

The table above is illustrative. These numbers are **deterministic and you can reproduce them locally**:

**Parser fidelity** — SARIF export and the CI gates depend on parsing the model's Markdown report correctly. Against a **frozen corpus of 30 real, model-generated reports** spanning all six modes (`evals/benchmark-corpus.json`), each paired with an **independently graded** finding inventory (a separate model pass, spot-checked by hand), the shipped parser scores — run `npm run benchmark`:

| Metric (n = 30, frozen corpus) | Result | 
|---|---|
| Exact severity-count match (parser vs. graded truth) | 30 / 30 | 
| Risk-code precision / recall | 100% / 100% (56 finding-level codes, 0 FP / 0 FN) | 
| Valid SARIF 2.1.0 emitted | 30 / 30 | 

Because the parser is deterministic and the corpus is frozen, `npm run benchmark` gives everyone the same result, and `npm test` guards it as a regression. The corpus deliberately includes 9 false-positive / tradeoff reports (e.g. a ports-and-adapters design that *looks* like a dependency cycle) that must stay clean.

**Scoring determinism** — for a fixed finding set (2 Critical / 3 Warning / 1 Suggestion), the strictness presets produce exactly the scores their `common.md` table predicts: strict **34**, balanced **54**, legacy-friendly **74** — and only `legacy-friendly` leads with the top-three fixes.

**Model quality** — whether the model finds the *right* risks on real code is measured by the **57-scenario eval suite** (`evals/evals.json`): `npm run evals` (structural) and `npm run evals:live` (live, needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

Scope & honesty: the parser numbers are deterministic and exactly reproducible. The strictness and eval-suite figures are single-run live measurements against the model and vary slightly run to run. The parser benchmark measures report-parsing fidelity (does the tooling read every finding the report states?), not whether a given finding is "correct." The severity-count match is the fully independent signal; risk-code agreement also reflects the shared canonical name→code legend.

`~`= occasionally / inconsistently

**brooks-lint doesn't replace your linter.** It catches what linters can't: architectural drift, knowledge silos, and domain model distortion — the problems that slow teams down for months before anyone notices.

```
/plugin marketplace add hyhmrright/brooks-lint
/plugin install brooks-lint@brooks-lint-marketplace
```
Short-form commands (`/brooks-review`) are auto-installed on first session start. To install manually:

`cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/````
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/brooks-lint
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/brooks-lint/
```
`/extensions install https://github.com/hyhmrright/brooks-lint````
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.gemini/skills/      # flat — Gemini discovers skills only one level deep
```
Or simply:

`./scripts/install.sh gemini`

```
Install the brooks-lint skill from hyhmrright/brooks-lint
```
```
python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo hyhmrright/brooks-lint --path skills --name brooks-lint
```
```
git clone https://github.com/hyhmrright/brooks-lint.git /tmp/brooks-lint
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -r /tmp/brooks-lint/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/   # flat — matches the skill-installer layout
```
Or simply:

`./scripts/install.sh codex`

brooks-lint ships as standard Agent Skills. **Any agent that loads Agent
Skills runs all six modes with no conversion** — one command installs them:

```
# pick your platform; --project installs into the current repo instead of your global config
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyhmrright/brooks-lint/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- <platform>
#   <platform> = opencode · cursor · windsurf · antigravity · pi · kiro · copilot · droid · gemini · codex · agents
```
The installer copies the skills **flat** into the right folder for your platform, so the shared
framework (`../_shared/`) always resolves — you can't get the layout wrong. Then just ask
("review this PR", "audit the architecture") and the matching skill auto-triggers from its
`description`. New to skills, or using another agent? See **docs/getting-started.md**.

**OpenCode**

`./scripts/install.sh opencode` → `~/.config/opencode/skills` (also reads `~/.claude/skills` and
`AGENTS.md`). Full guide: docs/opencode-setup.md.

**Cursor** (2.4+)

`./scripts/install.sh cursor` → `~/.cursor/skills` (also `.agents/skills`; reads `AGENTS.md`).
Full guide: docs/cursor-setup.md.

**Windsurf** (Cascade)

`./scripts/install.sh windsurf` → `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills` (reads `AGENTS.md`).
Full guide: docs/windsurf-setup.md.

**Antigravity** (Google)

`./scripts/install.sh antigravity --project` → `.agent/skills` (reads `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md`).
Full guide: docs/antigravity-setup.md.

**pi** (earendil-works)

`./scripts/install.sh pi` → `~/.pi/agent/skills`, or point pi's `skills` setting at a clone.
Full guide: docs/pi-setup.md.

**GitHub Copilot**

`./scripts/install.sh copilot --project` → `.github/skills` (also auto-detects `.claude/skills`; reads
`AGENTS.md`). Full guide: docs/copilot-setup.md.

**Kiro** (AWS)

`./scripts/install.sh kiro` → `~/.kiro/skills` (auto-registers `/brooks-review`; reads `AGENTS.md`).
Full guide: docs/kiro-setup.md.

**Factory Droid**

`./scripts/install.sh droid` → `~/.factory/skills` (registers `/brooks-review`; reads `AGENTS.md`).
Full guide: docs/factory-droid-setup.md.


🧪 Verification status.Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI are maintainer-verified. The eight platforms above are documented from each tool's official skill spec and verified at the file-layout level (the installer is tested), but not yet end-to-end run by the maintainer on every platform. Tried one — workingorbroken? Open an issue with the platform, version, and what you saw. Another Agent-Skills agent? It almost certainly works the same way — tell us and we'll add it.

The skills also trigger automatically when you discuss code quality, architecture, maintainability, or test health.

These platforms invoke Agent Skills automatically from each skill's `description` — just ask
("review this PR", "audit the architecture", "where's our worst tech debt?") and the matching mode
runs. For explicit invocation, use the platform's skill-command syntax (e.g. pi registers each skill
as `/skill:brooks-review`; Cursor and OpenCode expose `/brooks-review` once the skill is discovered).

Runs abbreviated scans across all four quality dimensions and produces a weighted composite Health Score (0–100). Use it before a release, when onboarding a new team, or whenever you want a big-picture "how are we doing?" report. For deeper diagnosis on any dimension, use the focused skill instead.

```
/brooks-sweep                       # Claude Code (short form) / Gemini CLI
/brooks-lint:brooks-sweep           # Claude Code (full form)

```
Runs a unified scan across all production (R1–R6) and test (T1–T6) decay risks plus architecture in a single pass, then applies fixes: safe changes are auto-applied immediately, multi-file or interface-touching changes require confirmation, and complex architectural decisions are flagged as manual items. Outputs a Fix Log, Health Score delta, and a residual item list.

Place a `.brooks-lint.yaml` in your project root to customize review behavior:

```
version: 1
strictness: balanced   # strict | balanced (default) | legacy-friendly — softer scoring for legacy code
disable:
  - T5   # skip coverage metrics check — we don't enforce coverage
severity:
  R1: suggestion   # downgrade Cognitive Overload findings for this domain
ignore:
  - "**/*.generated.*"
  - "**/vendor/**"
# custom_risks:   # define project-specific Cx codes — see skills/_shared/custom-risks-guide.md
# suppress:       # downgrade specific findings by risk + path (e.g. accepted legacy debt)
```
Copy `.brooks-lint.example.yaml` as a starting point.
All settings are optional — omit the file entirely for default behavior.

| Setting | Description | 
|---|---|
| `strictness` | Scoring preset: `strict`,`balanced`(default), or`legacy-friendly`(lighter deductions, leads with top fixes) | 
| `disable` | Risk codes to skip ( `R1`–`R6`,`T1`–`T6`) | 
| `severity` | Override severity tier ( `critical`/`warning`/`suggestion`) | 
| `ignore` | Glob patterns for files to exclude | 
| `focus` | Evaluate only these risk codes (cannot combine with `disable`) | 
| `custom_risks` | Define project-specific risk codes ( `C1`,`C2`, …) — see`custom-risks-guide.md` | 
| `suppress` | Downgrade specific findings by risk + path (optional `expires:`date) | 

In the age of AI-assisted coding, we're writing more code faster than ever. But the insights from six decades of software engineering haven't changed:


"The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one."— Frederick Brooks

AI can help you write code faster, but it can't tell you whether you're building a cathedral or a tar pit. **brooks-lint bridges that gap** — it brings the hard-won wisdom of twelve classic engineering books into your modern development workflow.

The decay risks these authors identified are more relevant than ever:

- **Adding AI assistants**doesn't fix cognitive overload or domain model distortion
- **Generating more code**increases change propagation and knowledge duplication
- **Moving faster**makes accidental complexity and dependency disorder even more dangerous

Automate brooks-lint on every PR using the GitHub Action:

```
# .github/workflows/brooks-lint.yml
name: Brooks-Lint PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  brooks-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: hyhmrright/brooks-lint/.github/actions/brooks-lint@main
        with:
          mode: review
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          fail-below: 70
```
See `docs/github-action-example.yml` for the full template.

The action posts the review as a PR comment and optionally fails the check if the Health Score drops below a threshold. If `.brooks-lint-history.json` is committed to your repo, the comment also includes a trend delta (e.g., "85 → 82 (−3) over last 3 runs").

**Quality gates and Code Scanning.** Beyond `fail-below`, the action exposes:

```
        with:
          mode: review
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          fail-on: critical            # fail on any Critical finding (none | warning | critical)
          fail-on-regression: true     # fail if the Health Score dropped vs the last run
          sarif-file: brooks-lint.sarif  # also upload findings to GitHub Code Scanning
```
`fail-on-regression` reads `.brooks-lint-history.json`, so commit that file to enforce "no new regressions". Setting `sarif-file` makes findings appear inline on the PR's **Files changed** tab and requires `security-events: write` permission on the job.

**Cost:** ~$0.05–0.15 per PR run depending on diff size and model. Recommend running on `pull_request` events only.
