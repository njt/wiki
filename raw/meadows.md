# Meadows

**[Try it in your browser →](https://lorezzed.github.io/meadows/)**

A tiny text language for **stock-and-flow diagrams** — the system-dynamics notation
of Donella Meadows' *Thinking in Systems* — with an interactive playground that
draws the model as a live force-directed diagram and simulates its behavior over
time.

You type a model:

```text
| =>inflow [water in tub: 50] =>outflow: 5 |
```

![The playground: the one-line bathtub model in the editor on the left above a
chart of its level falling from 50 to 0, and on the right the compiled diagram
— a cloud, the inflow faucet, the "water in tub" box, the outflow faucet, and
a second cloud, joined by grey flow pipes.](docs/hero.png)

Meadows compiles it into a graph (stocks as boxes, flows as faucets on pipes,
clouds for whatever lies outside the model boundary, thin curved arcs for
information links), lays it out with d3 forces, and — when the model carries
numbers — integrates it and plots each stock's trajectory in a chart, complete
with dashed goal lines. The built-in example buttons reproduce the book's
figures, from the first bathtub through the thermostat, population, dealership,
and fishery models of chapters 1–5.

Under the hood it is two halves: a **PureScript compiler** (`src/`) that turns
source text into graph JSON, and a **TypeScript + d3 frontend** (`ui/`) that
renders and simulates the compiled graph.

## Quick start

The toolchain (purs, spago, node 22, esbuild) is pinned by a Nix flake; every
`make` target wraps `nix develop`, so you only need Nix with flakes enabled.

```bash
make init         # install Nix, if you haven't (https://nixos.org/download/)
make dev          # bundle, watch, and serve the playground (open http://localhost:8000)
make test         # full test battery: unit suite, goldens, headless frontend checks
make run-with "a->b"          # CLI: compile a DSL string, print its graph JSON
make run-with in="[a]=>f[b]"  # in= form REQUIRED when the input contains '='
make shell        # drop into the dev shell (purs, spago, node, esbuild)
```

If you edit the compiler (`src/*.purs`), run `make build` (i.e. `spago build`) —
the frontend imports the *compiled* backend from `output/`, so a browser refresh
alone will silently run stale code.

## The language

A model is a sequence of statements, one per line (blank lines are ignored).
Each statement is a chain of nodes joined by arrows. `//` starts a comment,
which runs to the end of the line, on a line of its own or after a
statement.

| You write | You get |
|---|---|
| `name` | a **dot** — an auxiliary variable |
| `[name]` | a **stock** — an accumulation, drawn as a box |
| `[name: 50]` | a stock with initial level 50 |
| `\|` | a **cloud** — a boundless source/sink outside the model boundary |
| `=>name`, `<=name` | a **flow** through a valve (**faucet**), in the arrow's direction |
| `->`, `<-` | an **information arrow** (who reads whom) |
| `R(...)`, `B(...)` | a reinforcing / balancing **loop label** over everything inside |
| `name: 5` | a value — initial rate for a faucet, constant for a dot |
| `name: 0 @5: 3` | a **schedule** — 0 until t=5, then 3 |
| `name: (expr)` | a **formula** — a rate law or computed auxiliary |
| `// note` | a **comment** — ignored through the end of the line |

### Names and identity

Names are plain words, and adjacent words join: `water in tub` is one name
(whitespace is normalized, so `water   in   tub` is the same name). A word
starts with a letter and may continue with letters, digits, or underscores
(`a2` is one name); a *leading* digit starts a number instead, and no other
punctuation — apostrophes included — belongs to a name.

**Identity is by name.** The first mention of a name creates its node; every
later mention — anywhere in the model — refers to that same node. This is the
whole mechanism for building webs: draw a stock on one line, then arrow into it
from three other lines. Clouds are the exception: every `|` is its own
anonymous cloud, and they never merge.

### Stocks, flows, clouds

Flows read in the direction of their arrow. The canonical bathtub:

```text
| =>inflow [water in tub] =>outflow |
```

water flows from a cloud through the `inflow` faucet into the stock, and out
through `outflow` to another cloud. `<=` is the mirrored form (flow runs right
to left). A stock can take any number of flows across statements:

```text
| =>rain [water in reservoir] =>evaporation |
| =>river inflow [water in reservoir] =>discharge |
```

Both lines name the same stock, so the reservoir ends up with two inflows and
two outflows.

### Information arrows

`->` and `<-` draw the thin curved arcs that carry *information* — what a
decision point can see. Chains hop node to node, and `a <- b -> c` fans both
arrows out of `b`:

```text
[stock2] =>outflow |
stock2 -> outflow
desired inventory -> discrepancy
profit <- price <- yield per unit capital -> extraction
```

The first two lines are the book's figure 8: a stock whose drain reads its own
level. Note that the arrow says `stock2`, not `[stock2]` — brackets *declare*
the stock, and every later mention is just its name.

In the drawn diagram an information arrow never touches a stock's body
directly: it lands on a small **port** circle pinned to the stock's edge (you
can drag a port along the boundary to taste).

### Loop labels

`R(...)` and `B(...)` mark reinforcing and balancing feedback loops. Every node
mentioned inside the parentheses is tagged as a member, and the diagram floats
a single `R` or `B` letter at the loop's center. Labels are purely
descriptive — evaluation and simulation are unchanged by them.

```text
[coffee temperature] =>cooling |
B(coffee temperature -> discrepancy -> cooling)
room temperature -> discrepancy
```

A loop may open a statement and be continued by arrows (`B(...) <- thermostat
setting` — the tail's nodes are *not* loop members), but a loop is never an
interior term: `a->R(b)` is a parse error. The lexeme is exactly uppercase
`R(` / `B(` — a bare `R`, or `Rx(`, is just an ordinary name.

### Values

Numbers attach in exactly three places — a stock's brackets, a faucet's name,
a dot's name:

```text
[water in tub: 50]        stock: initial level
=>outflow: 5              faucet: rate (per time unit)
room temperature: 18      dot: a constant
```

A number anywhere else (`[a]: 5`, a bare `5` in a chain) is a positioned parse
error. Literals are plain decimals with an optional sign — `3`, `0.25`, `-2`;
`5.` and exponent notation don't lex.

The **first** explicit annotation for a name wins: later annotations are
ignored, and value-less mentions never erase an earlier value. (A schedule or
formula counts as the annotation, as a unit.)

### Schedules

A faucet or dot value may step at fixed times: `initial`, then `@time: value`
pairs, each holding until the next — piecewise-constant.

```text
| =>inflow: 0 @5: 5 [water in tub: 50] =>outflow: 5 |
| =>espresso: 0 @1: 240 @1.5: 0 @6: 240 @6.5: 0 [caffeine in blood: 0] =>metabolism |
metabolism: (0.14 caffeine in blood)
```

The first is the book's figure 7 (the tap opens at t=5); the second is two
espresso shots as pulses, draining against a proportional decay (a formula —
see below), so the afternoon shot stacks on the morning's residue. Without
that drain line `metabolism` would be a *bare* faucet — a closed tap — and the
caffeine would only ever climb.

Schedules model *genuine discrete events* — a valve opening, a dose. A
smoothly changing quantity should be written as a formula of `t` instead.

### Formulas

`name: (expr)` attaches an expression. On a **faucet** it is a rate law; on a
**dot** it makes a computed auxiliary (or, if it references no other nodes, a
driving curve). Since names are identity, you can annotate on a separate line
from where the node first appeared:

```text
[susceptible: 990] =>infection [infected: 10]
infection: (0.001 susceptible * infected)
```

Inside the parentheses:

- **Operators** `+ - * / ^` with the usual precedence; `^` binds tightest and
  is right-associative (`x^2y` is `(x²)·y`, `2x^2` is `2·(x²)`).
- **Juxtaposition multiplies**: `2x`, `14 capital`, `2(a + b)`. But two *names*
  side by side join into one name — `output fraction` is a single name, and so
  is `pi t`; write `output * fraction` and `pi * t` to multiply.
- **References** to other nodes by name read their current value. Each
  reference automatically draws the information arrow it implies (deduplicated
  against arrows you drew by hand, so formulas and `R(...)` annotations compose
  without doubled arcs). References must be stocks or dots — reading a faucet
  is a model error, *except* through a time shift (below).
- **Reserved words**, reserved only inside formulas: the time variable `t`,
  the constant `pi`, and the functions `cos(x)`, `sin(x)`, `min(a, b)`,
  `max(a, b)` (the comma is legal nowhere else). A reserved function name
  opens a call exactly when a `(` follows; a bare `cos` is an ordinary node
  reference. Outside formulas all six are ordinary names — `t -> b` names a
  node called `t`.
- A formula that references no nodes is **closed** — pure mathematics of `t` —
  and acts as a driving variable, like the book's cold-day outside temperature:

```text
outside temperature: (2.5 + 7.5 * cos(2 * pi * t / 10))
fertility: (max(0.09, 0.21 - 0.06 * t))
```

Formulas may read each other (computed auxiliaries chain), but a cycle of
formulas (`a: (b)` with `b: (a)`) is rejected as a model error. To close a
feedback loop through equations, route it through a time shift — that's what
delays are for.

### Time shifts (delays)

`x(t - T)` is the value `x` had exactly `T` ago — a pipeline delay:

```text
perceived sales: (sales(t - perception delay))
deliveries: (orders to factory(t - delivery delay))
breeding: (price(t - 2))
```

Rules of the form:

- The shift opens on the exact token pair `(t` after a name, group, or call —
  so `x(a + b)` stays juxtaposed multiplication.
- The shift time is **one multiplicative term**: `x(t - 3 - d)` is an error;
  write `x(t - (3 + d))`.
- `x(t)` is just `x`; shifts chain left to right (`x(t - 2)(t - 3)` delays the
  delayed signal).
- A shift's *input* may be a faucet — reading a flow's rate through a delay is
  legal (the dealership's `orders to factory(t - delivery delay)`), though the
  shift's *time* still can't be.
- Shifts mint no nodes, so a delayed model's diagram keeps the book figure's
  exact node census. And because a shift's value is last step's state — never
  a recursive read of its input — a formula may close a loop through one:
  `a: (a + 1)` is a cycle error, while `a: (a(t - 1) + 1)` is legal.

A delay is also what makes a loop *oscillate*. The hog cycle — farmers who
breed on the price they saw two units ago:

```text
| =>breeding [pigs at market: 90] =>sales |
breeding: (price(t - 2))
price: (200 - pigs at market)
sales: (0.5 pigs at market)
B(breeding <- price <- pigs at market)
```

Every farmer is acting on information that is already out of date, so supply
keeps overshooting demand: the herd surges from 90 to 177, slumps to 95, and
settles only slowly, each swing a little smaller than the last (the
**boom & bust** button — raise `t =` to 40 to watch the swings die down).
Drop the shift, writing `breeding: (price)`, and the model still compiles —
this loop runs through a *stock*, not formula-to-formula, so there was never a
cycle to reject — but the herd slides straight to 133 and sits there. The
oscillation is the delay, and nothing else.

There is deliberately no smoothing primitive: perception-style reads *are* the
pipeline shift, and exponential approach falls out of goal-seeking faucets.

### Errors

Lex and parse errors are positioned — `Tokenization error: line 1, column 3: …`,
`Parsing error: line 2, column 4: …` — and semantic ones (formula cycles, a
formula reading a faucet outside a shift) come back as `Model error: …`. In
the playground a failing model flags the editor red and shows the message; the
last good diagram stays on screen while you fix it.

## How models run

The chart integrates the model with forward Euler at `DT = 0.05` over a horizon
of 10 time units by default (the `t =` field below the chart sets 1–1000).
Semantics, per node:

- A **stock** starts at its value and changes only by its flows. Levels never
  go negative: each step, a stock's outflows are rationed by what it actually
  holds, so an empty tub stops draining and chained stocks conserve material.
- A **faucet with a number** runs at that constant rate; a schedule steps the
  rate at its `@` times.
- A **faucet with a formula** evaluates its rate law every step over current
  levels and values, clamped at 0 — a tap never runs backward. (Non-finite
  arithmetic, e.g. division by zero, reads as 0.)
- A **bare faucet** is a closed tap — unless the information arrows into it
  give it behavior. Walking those arrows back through relay dots (value-less
  ones, or computed auxiliaries like a `discrepancy`):
  - **Goal-seeking** (the book's balancing loops, figures 10–11): if the walk
    reaches exactly one *valued* dot, that dot's reading is the **goal** and
    the faucet's own number is the **gain** — `rate = gain × discrepancy`,
    draining above the goal or filling below it, an exponential approach. The
    goal may be a constant, a schedule, or a closed curve; the chart draws it
    as a dashed line in the goal dot's color. A faucet with *no* number
    goal-seeks too when its stock's level and the valued dot meet in a relay
    dot on the way — a discrepancy between them — closing the gap at a gain
    of 1 per time unit. Give figure 16's `outside temperature` a value and
    its bare `heat to outside` leak does exactly that: the room evens out
    between the furnace and the outside.
  - **Reinforcing** (figures 12–13): if the faucet has *no* number, the walk
    also reaches the faucet's own stock through a drawn arrow — the
    level→faucet arc that closes an R loop — and the number arrives beside
    the level instead of meeting it in a relay, the valued dot becomes a
    **factor** on the level: `rate = factor × level`, compound interest
    filling or exponential decay draining.
  - Ambiguous webs (two valued dots, stocks on both sides) fall back to the
    plain constant-rate reading.
- A **time shift** is a ring buffer of `T/DT` samples (rounded to whole steps,
  minimum one), advanced once per step. At t=0 every shift primes to its
  input's value at that moment, so a model written in equilibrium holds
  exactly. A faucet read through a shift reports its *applied* (post-ration)
  rate.

![The thermostat model: the editor holds five statements, the chart shows room
temperature climbing from 10 and levelling onto a dashed line at 18, with a
second dashed line at 10 for the outside temperature. The diagram is one band
— cloud, furnace faucet, room temperature box, heat-loss faucet, cloud — with
a B floating in each of the two feedback loops beneath it.](docs/thermostat.png)

The book's figure 18, a thermostat fighting a cold day: each dashed rule is a
goal dot's reading, drawn in that dot's own colour — the same hue the name
wears in the editor and the diagram.

Only stocks plot as chart series. The chart has a hover crosshair with a
tooltip reading out every line (keyboard: `←`/`→` to step, Shift for ×10, Esc
to dismiss).

The engine lives in `ui/simulate.ts`, pure and dependency-free, and is pinned
by headless tests against the real compiled backend.

### The flows checkbox

Stocks plot; flows don't — a rate is not an accumulation, and the book's
charts are level charts. But the rates are what move the levels, so a
**flows** checkbox beside the `t =` field overlays them: checked, the chart
adds a thin solid line per faucet, tracing its *applied* rate. The caffeine
example is the case for it: each espresso shot runs at 240 an hour for half an
hour — a spike to 240 on the chart — while the level it fills climbs only by
the 120 that half hour delivers, less what metabolism burns meanwhile.

A model with a **delay** hides its whole story in the flows: the gap between
what is happening and what the decision-maker *sees* is invisible on the stock
line. So when a model contains a time shift, the checkbox overlays that gap
instead. It's the book's figure 33, the panel behind the dealership's
oscillation.

Checked, a delay model's chart adds one thin line per node touched by a shift:

- the shift's **owner** — the node whose formula contains it, i.e. the
  delayed copy — **dashed**;
- the shift's **input**, when that input is a plain reference, **solid**.

A stock never joins: it already has a level line. A node in both roles plots
once, dashed. Each line wears its node's own accent — the same hue it has in
the editor and the diagram — and the dash is shorter than the goal rules' so
the two dashed families stay apart. A faucet's sample is its *applied*
(post-ration) rate; a dot's is its computed value. Samples align one-for-one
with the stock series, and the flow lines join the y-domain, which is why an
order backlog swinging negative can pull the axis below zero.

Load **figure 31 & 33**, tick **flows**, and read the four lines against each
other (1 unit = 10 days). Customer demand steps up on day 25:

| line | style | moves |
|---|---|---|
| `sales` | solid | day 25 — demand steps |
| `orders to factory` | solid | day 25.5 — the dealer reacts |
| `perceived sales` | dashed | day 30 — *5 days* after sales |
| `deliveries` | dashed | day 30.5 — *5 days* after the order |

![The dealership in the flows view: the flows box is ticked beside the t field
and the chart carries five lines over five time units — flat at 200 until day
25, then a solid green orders-to-factory line rising and swinging while a
dashed green deliveries line traces the same shape half a unit behind
it.](docs/flows.png)

Each dashed line trails its solid partner by exactly its delay — a perception
delay of 0.5 and a delivery delay of 0.5, both 5 days on this axis. Those two
gaps are what makes the inventory swing: cut both delays to a single step and
the oscillation vanishes outright — the lot dips to 198, settles on the new
220, and never moves again, against the 127-to-400 swing it has at 0.5. The
stock line alone never shows you why.

The box is off by default, so figures 32 and 34–36 plot the bare stock line
the book prints; figure 33's view, and the harvest-rate panels of the
fishery figures 43–45, are one tick away. The box is yours alone, and nothing
but a click sets it: an example is exactly its source text, with nothing
beside it to preset the view, so loading one never touches the box (just as
it never touches `t =`); and the box isn't part of the page's link, so every
page load, reload or shared link, starts with it unticked.

### The animate toggle

The chart draws a run as lines; the **animate** button in the diagram's
bottom-right corner plays the same run on the diagram itself. It's on from
the start, so a model plays as soon as it loads; press it to hold the
diagram still. If your system asks for reduced motion, nothing moves until
you press it: a new model, a reload, or a link that animates waits for your
press. The setting itself stays as it was, so a link you pass on still
animates for everyone else. The whole
horizon sweeps by in twelve seconds, whatever `t =` says, rests on the final
state, and loops. A playhead crosses the chart in step, a clock beside the
button tells the time, and every mark reads the chart's own numbers:

- each **stock** fills like a tank, tinted in its accent, with its level read
  out under its name;
- each **flow pipe** carries bubbles that run at its faucet's rate — a shut
  tap's pipe goes still;
- each **feedback loop** beats: its letter swells, and a violet pulse sets out
  from the loop's stock and travels its links in causal order — along the
  information arrows, then down the flow back into the stock (against the
  material, for an outflow: the drain acts on the tank it empties).

A loop beats in proportion to its busiest faucet's flow and falls silent while
its taps are shut, so the pulses tell each loop's story: figure 13's
reinforcing interest loops quicken as the balances compound, figure 11's
balancing coffee loops slow as each cup closes on room temperature, and in
figure 16 the loop through the unmodeled leak never beats at all. All the
tanks share one scale — the run's highest level — and all the pipes and pulses
another, its fastest flow: the chart's single y-axis in miniature, so the
comparisons stay honest. Figure 13's five accounts open on the same tank, and
the ten-percent loop opens beating five times as fast as the two-percent one.
A model with loops but no numbers still animates: its loops beat steadily, the
pulses tracing the structure.

The toggle keeps playing through edits and example loads (a load restarts the
run from the beginning), and dragging, panning, and the palette all work
mid-run.

## The playground

The page opens on **leaky bucket**, one of the starter models, already
running: its tank fills, both pipes flow, its loop beats, and the chart
settles onto the equilibrium.

- **Example buttons** open on five sketches with no numbers at all: hunger
  (one balancing loop), chicken & egg (a reinforcing loop against a
  balancing one), burnout (a fix that backfires), predator & prey (two
  populations), and confidence (a loop with no stocks). They're structure
  alone, so the chart stays empty while the diagram draws every loop and
  animate still pulses them. Eight starter models
  follow, the simplest systems with one behavior each: piggy bank (a
  straight line), inbox (the net of two flows), rabbits (exponential
  growth), medicine (exponential decay), leaky bucket (an equilibrium),
  learning (goal-seeking), fish pond (an S-curve), and snowmelt (two stocks
  in a chain). A few showcase models come next — epidemic, caffeine, boom &
  bust, skydiver, plus one per formula keyword — and then the book's
  figures, folded under their own heading (click it to open). Every
  example explains itself in comments under its model: the sketches walk
  each loop link by link and say why it reinforces or balances, and the
  rest say what the chart and the diagram are showing you, and why.
- The **editor** color-codes every recognized name with its node's accent —
  the same hue that node wears in the diagram and the chart, so a line in the
  chart, a box in the diagram, and a word in the source visually connect.
  Comments show in grey, names in them uncolored.
- The **format** button reprints the model in the canonical style (one
  statement per line, spacing normalized, comments kept — see
  `src/Formatter.purs`). It is token-preserving, so node identities and
  diagram positions survive; input that doesn't lex is left untouched.
- In the **diagram**: drag a node to pin it where you drop it; click a
  pinned node to release it back to the forces. Ports drag along their
  stock's boundary. Clicking a node's label renames it everywhere. Hovering
  a loop's `R` or `B` (or tabbing to it) highlights that loop: its nodes and
  the links joining them keep full strength while the rest of the diagram
  fades, and the letter turns violet. Dragging empty space pans; a `+` /
  `1×` / `−` cluster in the corner zooms (`1×` resets both), and oversized
  models auto-fit. Beside the cluster, **names only** (on by default) labels
  each node with its name alone, hiding its value, schedule, or formula —
  the editor still has them; release it for the full labels (`water in tub:
  50`). Nothing moves either way. The **animate** button in the corner below
  (on by default, unless your system asks for reduced motion) plays the run
  on the diagram (see [the animate toggle](#the-animate-toggle)).
- A **palette** in the diagram's other corner edits the model by drawing:
  pickers for a dot, stock, faucet or cloud place one at the next click; the
  arrow and flow pickers run a source→target pick; the `R` / `B` pickers mark
  a loop by clicking its nodes in order; and select / delete act on what's
  already there. Every one of them is a *text* edit — the statement is
  appended to (or removed from) the editor, so the source stays the model.
- The **address bar** is a link to what's on screen. It holds the model's
  text exactly as typed, the view (the chart's horizon, names only, animate,
  zoom and pan, which example sections are open), and every node you pinned
  or port you slid. The flows checkbox stays out of it: only a click sets
  it. It keeps up as you work without
  piling up history, so a reload, a bookmark, or a link you send reopens
  the same page. Nodes you haven't pinned lay themselves out afresh, as
  they do for an example. An example load does add a history entry, so
  Back brings back the model it replaced. The bare address is the opening
  page itself, the leaky bucket on the default view: change anything and
  the address takes a link (an emptied editor has a short one of its own),
  and put it back and the address is bare again.

## The CLI

`make run-with` compiles a model and prints the graph JSON the frontend
consumes:

```bash
$ make run-with "a->b"
{"nodes":[{"type":"dot","label":"a","id":"dot#0"},{"type":"dot","label":"b","id":"dot#2"}],"links":[{"type":"arrow","target":"dot#2","source":"dot#0"}]}
```

Nodes carry `type` (`dot` / `stock` / `faucet` / `cloud` / `port`), an opaque
`id`, a `label`, and optionally `value`, `steps`, `expr` (a resolved formula
tree), `parent` (ports), `group`, and `loop` tags. Links are `flow` or `arrow`
with `source`/`target` ids. Use the `in=` form whenever the input contains
`=`, because make would otherwise parse the argument as a variable override:
`make run-with in="[a]=>fill[b]"`.

`make test` runs every layer. The goldens pin the compiler's JSON output
byte-for-byte; after an *intended* output change, refresh them with
`node test/golden.mjs --capture`. The formatter, simulator, highlighter,
layout, playback, and permalink tests run `ui/*.ts` directly under node's
type stripping, all but the permalink codec against the real compiled
backend — another reason `spago build` must precede them (the `make test`
target does this for you).
