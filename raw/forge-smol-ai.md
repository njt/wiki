Both were successful push-triggered container workflows against production. The 92.0-second median is based on two runs, so it is a canary result rather than a percentile claim. The representative 91.1-second run restored the 118 MB workspace in 4.5s, the 313 MB npm/tool cache in 4.8s, and the 1.07 GB exact dependency tree in 4.8s; install then took 0.5s. Its listed stages total 85.1s, with 6.0s of workflow and telemetry overhead. The one-time cold population run took 261.6s, including 109.1s to create and upload the exact snapshot.'

## Accounts, teams, and service tiers

Forge resources are owned by a personal or organization account. Teams are
access groups inside organization accounts; they do not own service tiers,
quotas, or future billing. The resource-owning account determines the effective
`free`, `pro`, `team`, or `enterprise` tier.

Authenticated discovery:

  GET /api/accounts
  GET /api/accounts/:accountId
  GET /api/accounts/:accountId/capabilities

Capabilities are useful for preflight, but the server remains authoritative.
Repository configuration may disable capabilities or lower limits; it cannot
raise account or platform ceilings. Accounts that become over quota retain
read, export, deletion, and usage-reducing operations.

Public contract:
  https://forge.smol.ai/spec/accounts/v1
  https://forge.smol.ai/spec/identity/v1

Hosted applications that request Forge Identity can use the framework-neutral
account control from the platform browser client:

  import { forge } from "/.forge/client.js";
  forge.identity.mountAccountControl("#account");

The custom element emits `forge-identity-change` and `forge-account-select`.
Account selection is app-local context; it does not change resource ownership,
service tier, or the Forge control-plane account. Visitors can review disclosed
scopes and end active hosted-app sessions in Forge Settings.

Platform administrators can inspect the canonical account ledger at
`/admin/accounts`. The corresponding `/api/admin/accounts` endpoints expose
account search, tier catalog, effective entitlements, usage evidence,
side-effect-free change previews, and retry-safe append-only tier or override
writes. Every write requires an audit reason; ordinary users receive 403.

`/admin/operations` compares 7/30/90-day user and account growth, ranks
resource-owning accounts by retained bytes, and shows named request-pressure,
deployment-failure, and warning thresholds. Operators may append account
warnings or temporary personal-account request caps. Caps only lower an
existing fixed-window allowance, expire within 30 days, and can be cleared by
another append-only operation. Organization request caps are not supported
until traffic is attributable to a resource-owning account.

Forge user credentials have `active`, `suspended`, and `tombstoned` states.
Suspension invalidates password login, signed sessions, PATs, and Git
authentication through a user authorization generation. It also suspends the
personal account so account-generation fanout reaches hosted applications.
Tombstoning retains audit-safe identity and authorship rows while redacting
public identity fields; repository R2 and D1 data is removed first through the
normal asynchronous repository deletion coordinator.

---

## Forge repository agents

Every Forge repository has its own durable, multi-turn agent authority. Instant
is the only runnable profile in Phase 1: it can list/search/read bounded text at
one exact source SHA and return validated file citations. It cannot run a
shell, execute tests, access the network or secrets, write a branch, open a pull
request, or deploy.

Direct REST starts at:

  POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads
  POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id/messages
  GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id
  GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id/events?after=:cursor

Forge assigns readable `agent_thread_...` handles when one is not supplied.
External automations should use a repository-scoped personal access token or an
agent service-principal key with `agent:read` and `agent:message` grants.

The same authority is available through stateless Streamable HTTP MCP:

  POST /mcp/agents
  Authorization: Bearer <Forge token>

Tools: `forge_agent_message`, `forge_agent_get_thread`,
`forge_agent_list_threads`, and `forge_agent_list_events`. The message tool
returns after durable acceptance; read the thread or cursorable events for
completion. MCP Tasks and OAuth discovery are not part of Phase 1.

## Forge AI for deployed applications

Forge AI is a Forge-owned, server-side model-routing capability. Applications
declare named profiles in `app.ai.profiles` inside `forgeBuild.ts`; they never
provide provider credentials, base URLs, raw provider model IDs, tenancy, or
billing-account identifiers.

Supported now:

- logical route `forge/text-fast@1`;
- host-funded, non-streaming text inference;
- native Forge JS through `env.forge.ai.responses.create(...)`;
- same-account connected Cloudflare Workers through the private
  `env.FORGE_AI.responsesCreate(...)` RPC binding;
- metadata-only usage receipts with content logging off; and
- profile, request-rate, production-cost, and preview-cost ceilings.

Declare a connected server profile:

  import { defineForge, importWrangler } from '@smolai/forge/config';

  export default defineForge({
    version: 1,
    app: {
      entrypoint: 'dist/server/index.js',
      ai: { profiles: {
        gameCommentary: {
          model: 'forge/text-fast@1',
          audience: 'server',
          funding: ['host'],
          maxInputTokens: 2500,
          maxOutputTokens: 180,
          response: {
            type: 'json_schema',
            name: 'game_commentary',
            schema: { type: 'object' },
          },
          limits: {
            requestsPerMinute: 10,
            hostCostMicrosPerDay: 1000000,
            previewHostCostMicrosPerDay: 50000,
          },
          privacy: { contentLogging: 'off' },
        },
      } },
    },
    routes: [{ pattern: '/*', to: 'app.http' }],
    provider: {
      cloudflare: {
        wrangler: importWrangler('wrangler.toml', {
          shareProductionResources: true,
        }),
      },
    },
  });

Call it only from a Worker/server handler:

  const result = await env.FORGE_AI.responsesCreate({
    profile: 'gameCommentary',
    input: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'Use only approved public facts.' },
      { role: 'user', content: JSON.stringify(approvedEvidence) },
    ],
    billing: { source: 'host' },
    idempotencyKey: `commentary:${eventDigest}`,
  });

Requests contain 1-64 `system`, `user`, or `assistant` messages and an 8-128
character idempotency key. The normalized result contains `outputText`, optional
`outputJson`, logical route, estimated usage/cost, and a policy/pricing receipt.

Coding agents must apply an application timeout, validate `outputJson` against
the expected product shape and allowed facts, and preserve a deterministic
fallback. Declared JSON Schema currently requests and parses JSON but Forge does
not yet enforce full schema conformance. Idempotency prevents a second charge;
it does not replay stored output in this Alpha.

Browser code calls an app-owned, narrow server endpoint. The app remains
responsible for body validation, authentication or Turnstile, abuse controls,
and output validation. Do not author a `FORGE_AI` Wrangler binding; Forge owns
and injects it into eligible connected Worker Versions.

Unavailable: BYOK, browser-direct Forge AI, streaming, tools, media, embeddings,
provider selection, arbitrary models/URLs/headers, public HTTPS inference, and
cross-account connected transport. Internal OpenAI, Gemini, and Featherless
adapters exist, but connected applications currently always use Workers AI and
cannot select those providers.

## Why Forge Deploy instead of a raw Cloudflare deploy?

Cloudflare provides Forge's runtime, storage, networking, and state primitives.
Forge Deploy adds a Git-native release control plane above them:

- one exact pushed Git SHA identifies the source;
- configuration, application code, and assets are frozen into one deployment;
- every successful build receives an immutable preview before production;
- automatic activation fails closed if the SHA is no longer the configured
  branch head or required checks and protection policy no longer pass;
- provider publication, preview readiness, and production activation are
  recorded as distinct states;
- an activation retry recognizes when the exact target already became active,
  records the provider receipt, and completes Forge's pointer without changing
  traffic again; a different active version fails closed;
- deployment evidence joins the source, configuration, build, provider version,
  preview, and activation outcome; and
- rollback moves the production pointer to a prior ready deployment without
  rebuilding or rewinding durable state.

Repository build code receives no provider deployment credentials. Connected
Cloudflare applications can retain existing bindings and their production
domain while adopting Forge's immutable preview and activation workflow.
Deliberate manual promotion or rollback remains possible and is recorded as an
explicit administrator action.

Forge also applies this release model to its own API and web application.
`forgeBuild.ts` creates an immutable connected Cloudflare Worker candidate from
one exact Forge SHA. A platform administrator verifies its Forge preview before
promotion. Provider activation is serialized, checks the expected active Worker
version immediately before switching traffic, and records the resulting
Cloudflare deployment receipt.

Cloudflare does not issue standalone version-preview URLs for Workers that
implement Durable Objects. Forge stages those immutable candidates at zero
percent beside the exact current 100 percent production version, then selects
the candidate only through the Forge preview proxy with Cloudflare's
version-override header. Ordinary traffic remains on production until explicit
promotion.

The Forge control-plane hostname remains directly attached to the API Worker;
it is not routed through the user-content Sites edge. Wrangler administrator
access remains the independent recovery path. Agents must not describe this as
Forge replacing Cloudflare: Forge supplies the release control plane, while
Cloudflare remains the runtime and provider-level rollback surface.
After Wrangler recovery, a new Forge candidate freezes the observed provider
version as its activation base. Promotion compares against that exact base, so
Forge can resume normal release control without overwriting a newer unobserved
administrator deployment.

## Pull request deploy previews

For an enrolled repository, Forge may automatically build each open
same-repository pull request at its exact head SHA. Configure the policy from
the repository's Sites tab. The pull request shows the frozen commit, workflow
logs, an immutable deployment URL, and a stable PR URL:

  preview-pr-<pull-number>-<random>.sites.smol.ai

The stable URL advances only when a successful deployment still matches the
pull request's desired generation, exact head SHA, and current policy
generation. Late builds remain immutable but cannot move the alias backwards.
Closing or merging the pull request revokes the stable alias immediately.

Initial automatic previews are public-unlisted, receive no secrets, use
deployment-isolated state and preview quotas, deny runtime egress, and cannot
publish production. Fork pull requests and connected Cloudflare deployments
that share production resources are blocked.

API:

  GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/preview
  POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/preview/retry
  GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/pr-previews
  PUT  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/pr-previews

## Forge blog

Measured Git hosting releases, technical decisions, and their production proof
are published separately from the operating documentation:

  https://forge.smol.ai/blog
  https://forge.smol.ai/blog/feed.xml

The blog explains why a capability exists and what Forge learned while shipping
it. The documentation and public specifications remain the authoritative
contracts for supported behavior, limits, and APIs.

## JavaScript/TypeScript package-manager policy

For every new JavaScript or TypeScript project, Forge strongly recommends
**pnpm as the default package manager**. Bun is the preferred high-speed option
when the project's dependencies, lifecycle scripts, and runtime requirements
are compatible. npm and Yarn remain supported for existing repositories, but
agents should not choose them for a new project unless the user or an existing
project constraint requires it.

Declare the choice in `package.json` with the `packageManager` field and commit
exactly one matching lockfile:

- pnpm: `pnpm-lock.yaml` (recommended default)
- Bun: `bun.lock` (high-speed option)
- npm compatibility: `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- Yarn compatibility: `yarn.lock`

When onboarding an existing repository, preserve its current package manager.
When starting an unconfigured JS/TS repository, choose pnpm unless Bun was
explicitly selected. Remove stale lockfiles after a migration; conflicting
lockfiles are treated as an ambiguous configuration and trigger guidance in
Forge's UI and CLI.

---

## Migrate an existing repository to Forge Deploy

Forge Deploy requires a root-level `forgeBuild.ts`, but humans and agents do
not need to author it from scratch. After changing the Git remote and pushing,
run the migration assistant locally or open the repository's Sites tab:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://forge.smol.ai/<owner>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
sf migrate
```

For multi-repository GitHub migrations, `sf repo import github <org-or-user>`
streams ordinary Git receive-pack requests through bounded concurrent
multipart staging into Forge's restricted native-Git runner. Forge stores
immutable objects before moving refs, and keeps interrupted imports safe to
retry. There is no GitHub repository-size estimate
cutoff. Each individual push is bounded at 500 MiB; larger histories can use
incremental pushes.

The GitHub history importer preserves standard Git LFS pointer files but does
not copy GitHub-hosted LFS object bytes. Upload those bytes separately with a
standard client or Forge's authorized LFS HTTP endpoints. Exact-SHA builds of
already-managed pointers and the Sites asset adoption API do not require a
local `git-lfs` binary. The adoption API is implemented and tested in source,
but is not live until a separate Forge release. See `/spec/assets/v1`.

OpenNext can keep selected unchanged public LFS binaries deferred through the
build. Forge plans their provider identity from the verified content digest
and extension, then checksum-fences and base64-streams only the hashes the
connected provider requests. Aggregate release capacity is entitlement-driven
up to 1 GiB while Cloudflare's 25 MiB per-file and 100,000-file ceilings remain.
Connected Worker versions receive a reserved Forge-managed `FORGE_SOURCE_SHA`
plain-text binding with the exact 40-hex release commit; repository Wrangler
configuration cannot override it.

Repository-administrator asset adoption API:

  GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/migration/assets?sha=<40-hex-source-sha>
  POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/migration/assets

GET is read-only and returns the primary branch, exact source/head SHA, fixed
v1 suggestion policy, existing config, literal entries, and each object's Git
blob SHA, SHA-256 OID, size, and upload status. Upload objects reported with
`uploaded: false` through the existing standard Forge LFS Batch/basic HTTP API,
then inspect again. POST requires version 1, an idempotency key, matching exact
source/expected-head SHA, the primary target branch, reviewed entries, and the
exact object list. It revalidates byte identity and creates a derived migration
branch, commit, pull request, and immutable receipt. The migration PR's Deploy
preview is suppressed. This does not merge the PR, advance production, deploy,
or change DNS.

`sf migrate` statically inspects repository files, previews a complete typed
configuration, and explains compatibility findings. It does not execute
repository code. `sf migrate --json` is the non-interactive, read-only form.
For a repository containing both an HTTP Worker and assets, use
`--target http` or `--target assets` to make the same explicit choice offered
by the browser wizard.
`--write` creates a missing `forgeBuild.ts`; replacing one additionally requires
`--force`. `--commit` creates a local commit but never pushes it.

The Sites migration screen uses the same rules against an exact Forge commit.
Previewing never writes. Server-side write and overwrite actions create an
expected-head-protected Git commit, and overwrite also verifies the identity of
the existing configuration.

For pnpm v9 monorepos, exact-source builds use the frozen lockfile importer
index to discover the selected project and transitive declared `workspace:*`
dependencies without walking unrelated sibling workspaces. Unsupported
lockfile syntax falls back to conservative full-tree discovery.

Primary branch selection treats `main` and `master` equivalently when only one
exists. When both exist, `main` wins and Forge returns a warning because two
primary-looking branches are a likely source of confusion. Otherwise Forge
preserves a valid configured default branch.

Detection is not a compatibility promise. Existing Cloudflare bindings,
Durable Objects, secrets, scheduled jobs, service bindings, or unsupported
compatibility flags are reported as findings. Changing the Git remote does not
change an existing Cloudflare deployment, storage, DNS, or custom domain.

For migration evaluation, Forge can proxy compiled `app.http` routes to a
connected Cloudflare Worker deployment through the deployment's unlisted Forge
preview hostname. The trusted publisher must record a root HTTPS
`*.workers.dev` version-preview origin; credentials, paths, query strings,
fragments, nonstandard ports, and lookalike domains are rejected. Forge
rechecks deployment eligibility on every request, strips spoofed internal
request headers, sanitizes provider response headers and parent-domain cookies,
and applies `no-store`, baseline security headers, `noindex`, and the Forge
deployment receipt.

Declare this path with
`importWrangler("wrangler.toml", { shareProductionResources: true })` inside
`provider.cloudflare.wrangler` in `forgeBuild.ts`. Forge validates the checked-in
TOML as inert exact-commit data. The acknowledgement is required because the
preview inherits the connected Worker's D1, KV, R2, Durable Object, secret, and
service bindings and can read or mutate the same production resources.

This is a compatibility preview, not a confidentiality boundary or domain
cutover. The provider URL may remain directly reachable if discovered, and
direct requests bypass Forge access checks. Existing production routes, DNS,
storage, and custom domains remain unchanged until an administrator separately
graduates the domain.

## Agent Git Authentication Quickstart

Browser login authenticates the web app only. It does not configure credentials
for local `git pull` or `git push`.

### Paste this into an agent with browser access

```text
You are working with SmolForge at https://forge.smol.ai.

If a Chrome/browser tab is already signed in, use that existing browser session;
do not ask for the account password and do not sign the user out. Confirm the
active Forge account from the account menu or https://forge.smol.ai/settings
before making any write. Browser authentication is stored in that browser's
site storage, not in a cookie or the terminal.

For local Git work, open the target repository's Git / Agent Auth panel. Create
a short-lived, repository-scoped Personal Access Token (PAT) with only the
needed scopes, select the correct operating system, and run its generated setup
block in the local repository terminal. It installs the credential through the
OS credential helper and keeps `credential.useHttpPath` enabled. Never put a
PAT in a Git remote URL. Verify with `git ls-remote origin HEAD`, then revoke the
PAT when the task is complete if it will not be reused.

Do not copy, print, commit, or paste the browser session JWT into chat, shell
history, source code, a remote URL, or a transcript. Do not inspect browser
storage to obtain it; use the signed-in browser UI to create the scoped PAT.

If the browser session is unavailable or belongs to the wrong account, stop and
ask the user to sign in or switch accounts. Do not try to recover credentials
from the browser profile, keychain, or another application's storage.
```

This lets a browser-capable agent reuse an already authenticated web session
for Forge UI/API work. For Git, it must still use a repo-scoped PAT: the browser
session token is deliberately not a Git credential and must remain in browser
storage.

The supported agent path is the SmolForge CLI. It creates a repository-scoped
Personal Access Token (PAT), configures `credential.useHttpPath`, updates the
remote, and sends the PAT to the configured operating-system credential helper
without putting the token in the remote URL or command arguments.

```bash
npm install -g @smolai/forge
sf auth login --username <username>
sf auth git-credential <owner>/<repo>
git ls-remote origin HEAD
git push origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

`sf auth login` can read the password from stdin when no TTY is available. For
automation, `SMOLFORGE_USERNAME` and `SMOLFORGE_PASSWORD` are also accepted.
On macOS the credential installer selects `osxkeychain`; on Linux it selects
`libsecret`; on Windows it selects `manager-core`. If a helper is already
configured, the CLI preserves it. Override detection with `--helper <name>`.

To supply an existing PAT instead of creating one:

```bash
export FORGE_USERNAME=<username>
export FORGE_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>
sf auth git-credential <owner>/<repo>
```

For Git Smart HTTP, the remote remains
`https://forge.smol.ai/<owner>/<repo>.git`. The Basic-auth username is the Forge
username and the HTTPS password is the PAT. Tokens are scoped by repository path,
so `credential.useHttpPath` must remain enabled.

### Create and install a PAT manually

Create a PAT using the session Bearer token returned by `POST /api/auth/login`:

```http
POST /api/auth/tokens
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "codex-local",
  "scopes": ["repo:read", "repo:write", "transcripts:write"],
  "expires_in": "30d",
  "repository": "<owner>/<repo>"
}
```

The plaintext token is returned only in this creation response. On macOS, install
it without embedding it in shell history or the remote URL:

```bash
export FORGE_USERNAME=<username>
export FORGE_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>
git config --local credential.helper osxkeychain
git config --local credential.useHttpPath true
git remote set-url origin https://forge.smol.ai/<owner>/<repo>.git
printf 'protocol=https\nhost=forge.smol.ai\npath=<owner>/<repo>.git\nusername=%s\npassword=%s\n\n' \
  "$FORGE_USERNAME" "$FORGE_TOKEN" | git credential approve
unset FORGE_TOKEN
git ls-remote origin HEAD
```

On Linux, use `libsecret` in place of `osxkeychain` after installing the Git
credential libsecret helper. Never place a token directly in a Git remote URL.

### Non-interactive plaintext fallback

Use this only in an isolated, short-lived environment that has no secure
credential helper. The CLI requires `--plaintext` explicitly, stores the token
under `.git/credentials` with mode `0600`, and prints a warning:

```bash
export FORGE_USERNAME=<username>
export FORGE_TOKEN=<personal-access-token>
sf auth git-credential <owner>/<repo> --plaintext
unset FORGE_TOKEN
```

Remove the file when the job finishes:

```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/credentials"
```

---

## Authentication

Authenticated API requests use either a login-session JWT or a Personal Access
Token as a Bearer token. Token-management endpoints require a login-session JWT.
PAT access is limited by its scopes and optional repository restriction.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Get a token

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }
→ { "user": { "id", "username", "email" }, "token": "eyJ..." }
```

Use `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }` instead to sign in by email.

`GET /api/auth/login-options` returns the enabled sign-in controls and, once
multiple methods are available, a privacy-thresholded aggregate recommendation.
It never returns individual login activity or method counts.

```
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "...", "email": "...", "password": "..." }
→ { "user": {...}, "token": "eyJ..." }
```

```
GET /api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <token>
→ { "user": {...} }
```

```
GET /api/auth/whoami
Authorization: Bearer <token>
→ { "authenticated": true, "auth_type": "session"|"personal_access_token", "user": {...} }
```

### Personal Access Tokens

Supported scopes are `repo:read`, `repo:write`, `transcripts:write`,
`actions:read`, `actions:write`, `gist:read`, `gist:write`, and `wiki:ask`.
Supported expirations are `1h`, `1d`, `30d`, and `never`. Token values are
shown once in the creation response.

```
POST /api/auth/tokens
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
{ "name": "agent", "scopes": ["repo:read", "repo:write"], "expires_in": "30d", "repository?": "owner/repo" }
→ { "token": "forge_pat_...", "personal_access_token": {...metadata...} }
```

```
GET /api/auth/tokens
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
→ { "personal_access_tokens": [...metadata] }
```

```
DELETE /api/auth/tokens/:id
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
→ 204
```

## Gists

Gists are bounded text snippets with up to 10 files. Public gists appear in
discovery; unlisted gists are omitted from discovery but remain readable by
anyone who has the opaque URL.

```
GET /api/gists
Auth: optional (`gist:read` PAT scope)
Query: `page` (default 1), `per_page` (default 20, maximum 50), optional
`owner=<username>` for one owner's public gists, optional `q=<text>` to search
descriptions and filenames (maximum 64 characters)
→ {
    "gists": [{ "id", "description", "visibility", "file_count", "first_filename", "preview", "owner", ... }],
    "pagination": { "page": 1, "per_page": 20 }
  }

GET /api/gists?mine=1
Auth: required
Also accepts `page` and `per_page`.
→ {
    "gists": [public and unlisted gists owned by the current user],
    "pagination": { "page": 1, "per_page": 20 }
  }

POST /api/gists
Auth: required (`gist:write` PAT scope)
{
  "description": "optional",
  "visibility": "public"|"unlisted",
  "files": [{ "filename": "snippet.ts", "content": "export {}" }]
}
→ 201 { "gist": { ..., "files": [...] } }

GET /api/gists/:id
Auth: optional
→ { "gist": { ..., "files": [...] } }

GET /api/gists/:id/raw/:filename
Auth: optional
→ text/plain

GET /api/gists/:id/revisions
Auth: optional
Query: `page`, `per_page` (maximum 50)
→ { "revisions": [{ "id", "revision_number", "description", "visibility", "file_count", "created_at", ... }], "pagination": ... }

GET /api/gists/:id/revisions/:revisionId
Auth: optional
→ { "revision": { ..., "files": [{ "filename", "content", "position" }] } }

PUT /api/gists/:id/star
DELETE /api/gists/:id/star
Auth: required (`gist:write` PAT scope)
→ { "star_count", "fork_count", "viewer_has_star" }

POST /api/gists/:id/forks
Auth: required (`gist:write` PAT scope)
{ "revision_id": "exact immutable revision id" }
→ 201 { "gist": { ..., "forked_from": { "gist_id", "revision_id" } } }

PATCH /api/gists/:id
Auth: required, owner only (`gist:write` PAT scope)
{ "description", "visibility", "files" }
→ { "gist": { ..., "files": [...] } }

DELETE /api/gists/:id
Auth: required, owner only (`gist:write` PAT scope)
→ 204
```

Each filename is a root-level name, not a path. A file may contain at most
256 KiB of UTF-8 text and one gist may contain at most 1 MiB in total. Each
Gist retains at most 100 immutable revisions, each account retains at most
100 MiB of revision history, and search is derived metadata rather than
authoritative content.

## Repositories

```
POST /api/repos
Auth: required
{ "name": "my-repo", "description": "optional", "visibility": "public"|"unlisted"|"private", "license_spdx?": "MIT" }
→ { "repository": { "id", "name", "description", "visibility", "license_spdx", "default_branch", "created_at" } }

`visibility` is the sole repository visibility contract. `unlisted` repositories
are readable by direct URL but are omitted from public profiles and discovery.
```

```
GET /api/repos
Auth: required
→ { "repositories": [...] }
```

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo
Auth: optional (private repos require auth)
→ { "repository": { ..., "owner": { "username" }, "star_count": 0, "fork_count": 0, "viewer_permission", "is_owner", "can_fork", "parent" } }
```

```
PATCH /api/repos/:owner/:repo
Auth: required (user owner or organization owner/admin)
{ "name?", "description?", "visibility?", "license_spdx?", "default_branch?" }
→ { "repository": {...}, "newUrlPath?": "/newowner/newname" }
```

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/forks
Auth: required; viewer must be able to read the source and cannot own it
{ "name?": "destination-name", "visibility?": "public"|"unlisted"|"private" }
→ 202 { "repository": {...}, "url": "/viewer/destination-name", "job": {...}, "status_url": "/api/repository-jobs/:id" }
```

Forks receive an independent copy of Git objects and refs plus source ancestry and
license metadata. Issues, collaborators, secrets, workflows, webhooks, and
transcripts are not copied. Destination visibility defaults to the source visibility;
a private source can only be forked as private.

Forking runs as a durable background job with object/byte progress, cancellation,
three attempts, and cleanup. The destination stays private until the independent
copy is complete. Forks are limited to 5 GiB of stored Git objects.

```
GET /api/repository-jobs/:id
Auth: required (job requester)
→ { "job": { "status": "queued"|"running"|"succeeded"|"failed"|"cancelled", "progress": 0..100, ... } }

POST /api/repository-jobs/:id/cancel
Auth: required (job requester)
→ 202 { "job": {...} }
```

```
GET /api/licenses
Auth: not required
→ { "licenses": [{ "spdx_id", "name", "description", "url" }] }
```

```
PUT /api/repos/:owner/:repo/license
Auth: required (repository admin)
{ "license_spdx": "MIT"|"Apache-2.0"|"AGPL-3.0-or-later" }
→ 201 { "repository": {...}, "license_file_created": true, "commit": "...", "file": { "path": "LICENSE", "sha": "...", "size": 1077 } }
```

The license endpoint creates or updates `LICENSE` with canonical SPDX text and
advances the default branch with a real Git commit.

```
DELETE /api/repos/:owner/:repo
Auth: required (owner only)
→ 202 { "job": {...}, "status_url": "/api/repository-jobs/:id" }
```

### Stars

```
PUT    /api/repos/:owner/:repo/star      → { "starred": true }
DELETE /api/repos/:owner/:repo/star      → 204
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:repo/star      → { "starred": bool }

SmolForge currently supports fast-forward merges only. Diverged histories must
be reconciled locally before retrying; merge commits, squash, and rebase are not
yet supported.
```

## CI/CD Actions

Use `cache: auto` for a pnpm, Bun, or npm container job. Forge detects the
declared `packageManager` field or a sole matching lockfile and restores only
that manager's store/download cache. pnpm and Bun are pinned into the standard
container image; use their frozen-lockfile installs directly. Do not add npm to
a pnpm or Bun repository simply for caching. Yarn remains supported as a
package manager but is intentionally not cached by `auto` yet; Forge skips an
ambiguous or unsupported configuration safely.

Generated Deploy and Sites builds use this manager-aware mode automatically.
For npm, Forge may also restore an exact dependency snapshot keyed by the
immutable source SHA and normalized project root; pnpm and Bun continue through
their frozen store-backed installs.

Container workflows can opt into cross-build caches on each job:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runner: container
    cache: auto
    steps:
      - name: Install
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Test
        run: npm run test:unit
```

## Forge Deploy

Forge Deploy publishes an exact public-repository commit to
`{project}.sites.smol.ai`. It supports immutable assets, one HTTP application
handler, Forge-managed durable state, bounded managed realtime, immutable
previews, automatic or manual production publication, and pointer-based
rollback. The current preview is operator-allowlisted.

Install the public authoring package and add `forgeBuild.ts` at the repository
root:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @smolai/forge
```

```ts
import { defineForge } from '@smolai/forge/config';

export default defineForge({
  version: 1,
  name: 'my-app',
  app: {
    entrypoint: 'src/server.ts',
    assets: { directory: 'dist', fallback: 'index.html' },
  },
  routes: [
    { pattern: '/api/*', to: 'app.http' },
    { pattern: '/*', to: 'app.assets' },
  ],
});
```

Validate locally, then deploy through ordinary authorized Git:

```bash
npx smolforge deploy check
git push origin main
```

Forge evaluates `forgeBuild.ts` as static data without executing repository
code. `forge.yml` and `forge.yaml` are rejected. Preview URLs are
unauthenticated, unlisted, and `noindex`; their random hostname is not a
confidentiality boundary.

Application entrypoints default-export `{ async fetch(request, env) {} }`.
Use `env.forge.state.scope(name)` for `get`, `list`, `snapshot`, and atomic
`mutate`. Use state-bound `emit`, `env.forge.realtime.authorize`, and
`env.forge.realtime.snapshotResponse` for managed realtime. Runtime egress is
denied by default.

Repository administrators can configure and inspect Sites:

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/release-status
→ {
    "default_head_sha": "<40-hex>"|null,
    "state": "not_configured"|"deploying"|"needs_attention"|"production"|"out_of_date",
    "projects": [{
      "project_root": ".",
      "head_sha": "<40-hex>"|null,
      "latest": { "source_sha", "state", "release_id", "workflow_run_id", ... }|null,
      "production": { "source_sha", "state", "release_id", "hostname", ... }|null,
      "synchronized": true|false
    }]
  }

GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites
→ { "site": {...}|null, "production_url": "https://..."|null }

PUT /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites
{
  "slug": "stable-dns-label",
  "production_branch": "main",
  "build_command": "pnpm build",
  "output_dir": "dist",
  "spa_fallback": false
}
→ { "site": {...}, "production_url": "https://..."|null }

GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/deployments
→ { "deployments": [{ "source_sha", "status", "preview_url", "workflow_run_id", ... }] }
```

Use `actions/release-status` before deciding whether a push is building,
blocked, or in production. It is the shared Actions/Sites read model:
historical Action failures are history, not a current release backlog. A
successful ordinary Action means the workflow passed; it does not by itself
mean a release exists or production moved. `production.state: "production"`
proves the authoritative Forge pointer. It is not an HTTP health claim unless
`production.verification` records one; verify the returned hostname separately
when live behavior matters.

The site slug is permanent after creation. Initial enablement, re-enablement,
and suspension are platform-operator actions. Repository administrators may
disable, redeploy, or promote a successful immutable deployment:

```
PATCH /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/state
{ "state": "disabled" }

POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/deployments/:deploymentId/redeploy
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/sites/deployments/:deploymentId/promote
```

Do not treat a successful build as proof that production moved. Compare the
deployment SHA with `site.active_deployment_id`, and verify both the immutable
preview URL and production URL when present. Private, unlisted, deleted, or
suspended source repositories are not served.

`auto` resolves to the matching pnpm, Bun, or npm cache and its fingerprint
includes the manager/version, lockfile, package metadata, platform, runner
image, and normalized Deploy project root. Monorepo projects therefore warm
independently even when they share a root lockfile. Generated npm Deploy jobs
may additionally restore an exact `node_modules` snapshot; `npm-exact` remains
an explicit npm-only mode for authored workflows. Cache misses and restore/save
errors are non-fatal. Only trusted pushes to the current default-branch SHA can
write caches; pull requests are read-only cache consumers.

Project commands must honor Forge's cache environment. When using the legacy
`npm-exact` mode and `FORGE_EXACT_CACHE_HIT=1`, skip `npm ci` because the exact
`node_modules` tree is already restored. `FORGE_DEPENDENCY_CACHE_HIT=1`
indicates that the manager-aware cache was restored. Use `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE`,
`PNPM_STORE_DIR`, `BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR`, and `ESLINT_CACHE_LOCATION` rather
than hard-coding cache paths. Keep `build` and unit tests as separate commands
so a workflow can build once.

PUT  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/:filename  → { "workflow": {...} }
     { "content": "name: CI\non:\n  push:\njobs:..." }
DELETE /api/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/:filename → 204
```

## AI Transcripts

SmolForge stores AI coding agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, etc.) alongside commits. This is the core integration point for agents.

### Upload a transcript

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/transcripts
Auth: required
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": "uuid-of-session",
  "agent_type": "claude-code" | "claude-cowork" | "codex" | "copilot" | string,
  "commit_sha": "abc123...",  // optional, links transcript to a specific commit
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user" | "assistant" | "system",
      "content": "the message text",
      "timestamp": "2026-03-29T08:00:00Z",  // ISO8601
      "image_keys": ["key1", "key2"]         // optional, from image upload
    }
  ]
}

→ 201 {
  "id": 1,
  "repo_id": "...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "agent_type": "claude-code",
  "message_count": 42,
  "commit_sha": "abc123...",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```

Secret masking is applied automatically on storage. Patterns: `cfut_*` (Cloudflare), `sk-*` (OpenAI), `ghp_*` (GitHub), `AKIA*` (AWS), plus any repo-specific patterns.

### List transcripts

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/transcripts?page=1&limit=20
Auth: required
→ { "transcripts": [...], "pagination": { "page", "limit", "total", "pages" } }
```

### Get transcript by session ID

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/transcripts/:sessionId?full=true
Auth: required
→ { "id", "session_id", "agent_type", "commit_sha", "messages": [...] }

Without ?full=true, assistant messages are truncated to 500 chars.
```

### Get transcript by commit SHA

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/commits/:sha/transcript?full=true
Auth: required
→ same as above
```

### Upload transcript images

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/transcripts/:sessionId/images
Auth: required
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: file=@screenshot.png

→ { "key": "transcripts/repo-id/session-id/timestamp-random-filename.png", "url": "/api/repos/..." }
```

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/transcripts/images/:key
Auth: required
→ binary image data with Cache-Control: public, immutable, max-age=31536000
```

---

## Secret Masks

Secret masks define regex patterns that are automatically redacted in transcript content.

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/secret-masks
Auth: required
→ { "masks": [{ "id", "repo_id", "pattern", "label", "is_global", "created_at" }] }
```

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/secret-masks
Auth: required (write permission)
{ "pattern": "my_secret_[A-Za-z0-9]+", "label": "Internal API Key" }
→ { "id", "repo_id", "pattern", "label", "is_global": 0, "created_at" }
```

```
DELETE /api/repos/:owner/:repo/secret-masks/:id
Auth: required (write permission, cannot delete global masks)
→ { "success": true }
```

```
GET /api/secret-masks/global
Auth: none
→ { "masks": [...] }
```

Default global masks: `cfut_[A-Za-z0-9]+`, `sk-[A-Za-z0-9-]+`, `ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]+`, `AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}`

---

## Webhooks

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks
Auth: required (owner only)
{ "url": "https://example.com/webhook", "secret?": "hmac-key", "events?": "push,issues" }
→ { "webhook": { "id", "url", "events", "active", "created_at" } }

Events: push, pull_request, issues, issue_comment, create, delete
Default: "push"
```

```
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks           → { "webhooks": [...] }
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id       → { "webhook": {...} }
PATCH  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id       { "url?", "secret?", "events?", "active?" }
DELETE /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id       → { "success": true }
```

```
GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id/deliveries?limit=50
→ { "deliveries": [{ "id", "event", "payload", "response_status", "success", "delivered_at", "duration_ms" }] }

POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id/deliveries/:deliveryId/redeliver
→ { "delivery": {...} }
```

Webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256 if a secret is set. Headers:
- `X-SmolForge-Event`: event name
- `X-SmolForge-Delivery`: unique delivery UUID
- `X-SmolForge-Signature`: `sha256=<hex>` (only if secret is configured)

## Content Safety

```

## Git Smart HTTP (Clone/Push)

These endpoints implement the Git Smart HTTP protocol. They are NOT JSON APIs — they use the git pkt-line binary protocol.

```
GET  /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack         # clone/fetch discovery
GET  /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack        # push discovery (auth required)
POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack                           # clone/fetch data transfer
POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack                          # push data transfer (auth required)
```

Git authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth with the Forge username and a PAT as the
password. A web-session JWT belongs in API Bearer headers and is not a Git
password. See Agent Git Authentication Quickstart above.

Canonical clone URL: `https://forge.smol.ai/<owner>/<repo>.git`
URLs without the `.git` suffix are also supported.

## Automatic Transcript Attachment for AI Coding Agents

This section describes how to configure AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor CLI, Factory Droid, Devin for Terminal, OpenCode, etc.) to automatically store their conversation transcripts in SmolForge alongside the commits they produce.

Recommended first step:

```bash
sf hooks install <owner>/<repo> --agent all --git post-commit,pre-push
sf hooks status <owner>/<repo>
```

The CLI installs `.smolforge/hooks/upload-transcript.sh`, native lifecycle hook files where available, and Git hook backstops. Codex is supported through the Git hook path and `~/.codex/sessions` JSONL discovery. Claude Code uses a `PostToolUse` hook. Cursor, Factory Droid, and Devin get repo-local lifecycle hooks plus the Git backstop. OpenCode is supported through the Git backstop with best-effort SQLite extraction when `sqlite3` is available.

### Concept

1. The agent does work and makes git commits
2. Each commit includes a git trailer: `AI-Session: <session-id>`
3. After pushing, the transcript is uploaded to SmolForge's API with that session ID and commit SHA
4. SmolForge links them — the transcript appears on the commit detail page in the UI

### Prerequisites

Store these in your git config (or environment):
```bash
git config smolforge.token "your-jwt-token"
git config smolforge.url "https://forge.smol.ai"
```

Or as environment variables:
```bash
export SMOLFORGE_TOKEN="your-jwt-token"
export SMOLFORGE_URL="https://forge.smol.ai"
```

### Method 1: Backfill from Scratch (Claude Code)

Upload an entire session's transcript for all commits at once. Use this when you've completed a session and want to attach the full conversation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backfill-transcripts.sh
# Usage: ./backfill-transcripts.sh <owner> <repo> <session-file>

OWNER="$1"
REPO="$2"
SESSION_FILE="$3"
SESSION_ID=$(basename "$SESSION_FILE" .jsonl)

CF_TOKEN="${SMOLFORGE_TOKEN:-$(git config --get smolforge.token)}"
CF_URL="${SMOLFORGE_URL:-$(git config --get smolforge.url)}"

if [ -z "$CF_TOKEN" ] || [ -z "$CF_URL" ]; then
  echo "Error: Set SMOLFORGE_TOKEN and SMOLFORGE_URL or git config smolforge.token/url"
  exit 1
fi

# Find the most recent commit with this session's AI-Session trailer
COMMIT_SHA=$(git log --all --format='%H %B' | grep -B1 "AI-Session: $SESSION_ID" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')

# If no commit has the trailer, use HEAD
if [ -z "$COMMIT_SHA" ]; then
  COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  echo "No commit found with AI-Session trailer. Using HEAD: $COMMIT_SHA"
fi

# Parse the JSONL transcript file into SmolForge upload format
python3 -c "
import json, sys

messages = []
for line in open('$SESSION_FILE'):
    try:
        entry = json.loads(line)
    except:
        continue
    if entry.get('type') == 'human':
        content = entry.get('message', {}).get('content', '')
        if isinstance(content, list):
            content = ' '.join(c.get('text', '') for c in content if isinstance(c, dict) and c.get('type') == 'text')
        if content:
            messages.append({
                'role': 'user',
                'content': content,
                'timestamp': entry.get('timestamp', '')
            })
    elif entry.get('type') == 'assistant':
        content = entry.get('message', {}).get('content', '')
        if isinstance(content, list):
            content = ' '.join(c.get('text', '') for c in content if isinstance(c, dict) and c.get('type') == 'text')
        if content:
            messages.append({
                'role': 'assistant',
                'content': content,
                'timestamp': entry.get('timestamp', '')
            })

payload = {
    'session_id': '$SESSION_ID',
    'agent_type': 'claude-code',
    'commit_sha': '$COMMIT_SHA',
    'messages': messages
}
print(json.dumps(payload))
" | curl -s -X POST "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/transcripts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- | python3 -m json.tool

echo "Transcript uploaded for session $SESSION_ID → commit $COMMIT_SHA"
```

To find your Claude Code session files:
```bash
# List recent sessions
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10

# The session file path encodes the project directory
# e.g. ~/.claude/projects/-home-user-myproject/sessions/4cf341c0-3bd3-4cec-b8c4-9e62a1f90eae.jsonl
```

### Method 2: Incremental (Auto-Upload on Each Commit)

Set up a git post-commit hook that automatically uploads the transcript excerpt for each commit.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit
# Auto-uploads transcript for commits with AI-Session trailers

COMMIT_MSG=$(git log -1 --format=%B)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep "^AI-Session:" | awk '{print $2}')

if [ -z "$SESSION_ID" ]; then
  exit 0  # No AI-Session trailer, skip
fi

SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
CF_TOKEN="${SMOLFORGE_TOKEN:-$(git config --get smolforge.token)}"
CF_URL="${SMOLFORGE_URL:-$(git config --get smolforge.url || echo "https://forge.smol.ai")}"
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)
OWNER=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*/([^/]+)/([^/.]+)(\.git)?$|\1|')
REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*/([^/]+)/([^/.]+)(\.git)?$|\2|')

if [ -z "$CF_TOKEN" ] || [ -z "$OWNER" ] || [ -z "$REPO" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Find the session file
SESSION_FILE=$(find ~/.claude/projects/ -name "$SESSION_ID.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$SESSION_FILE" ]; then
  # Try Codex location
  SESSION_FILE=$(find ~/.codex/ -name "$SESSION_ID.json" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi

if [ -z "$SESSION_FILE" ]; then
  echo "SmolForge: Session file not found for $SESSION_ID"
  exit 0
fi

echo "SmolForge: Uploading transcript for session $SESSION_ID..."

python3 -c "
import json
messages = []
for line in open('$SESSION_FILE'):
    try:
        entry = json.loads(line)
    except:
        continue
    if entry.get('type') == 'human':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'user','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
    elif entry.get('type') == 'assistant':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'assistant','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
print(json.dumps({'session_id':'$SESSION_ID','agent_type':'claude-code','commit_sha':'$SHA','messages':messages}))
" | curl -s -X POST "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/transcripts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- > /dev/null

echo "SmolForge: Transcript uploaded."
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit`

### Method 3: Post-Push Hook (Recommended for Teams)

Upload transcripts after pushing, so the commit SHA is finalized. Add to `.git/hooks/post-push` or call manually:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# upload-transcripts.sh
# Scans recent commits for AI-Session trailers and uploads any missing transcripts

OWNER="$1"
REPO="$2"
BRANCH="${3:-main}"
LOOKBACK="${4:-10}"  # number of recent commits to check

CF_TOKEN="${SMOLFORGE_TOKEN:-$(git config --get smolforge.token)}"
CF_URL="${SMOLFORGE_URL:-$(git config --get smolforge.url || echo "https://forge.smol.ai")}"

git log --format='%H|||%B' -n "$LOOKBACK" "$BRANCH" | while IFS='|||' read -r SHA MSG; do
  SESSION_ID=$(echo "$MSG" | grep "^AI-Session:" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
  [ -z "$SESSION_ID" ] && continue

  # Check if transcript already exists
  EXISTS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/transcript" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN")

  if [ "$EXISTS" = "200" ]; then
    echo "Transcript already exists for $SHA ($SESSION_ID)"
    continue
  fi

  SESSION_FILE=$(find ~/.claude/projects/ -name "$SESSION_ID.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -z "$SESSION_FILE" ] && continue

  echo "Uploading transcript for $SHA ($SESSION_ID)..."

  python3 -c "
import json
messages = []
for line in open('$SESSION_FILE'):
    try: entry = json.loads(line)
    except: continue
    if entry.get('type') == 'human':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'user','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
    elif entry.get('type') == 'assistant':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'assistant','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
print(json.dumps({'session_id':'$SESSION_ID','agent_type':'claude-code','commit_sha':'$SHA','messages':messages}))
" | curl -s -X POST "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/transcripts" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @-

  echo "Done."
done
```

### Method 4: Claude Code Hooks (Recommended — Zero Config After Setup)

Claude Code's hook system can automatically upload transcripts whenever Claude makes a git commit. This is the cleanest approach — no git hooks needed, works across all repos.

Add this to `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "if": "Bash(git commit *)",
            "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/smolforge-transcript.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then create `.claude/hooks/smolforge-transcript.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Claude Code PostToolUse hook — auto-upload transcript after git commit
# Receives JSON on stdin with session_id, tool_input.command, cwd, etc.

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_input',{}).get('command',''))" 2>/dev/null)

# Only handle actual git commits
echo "$COMMAND" | grep -q "git commit" || exit 0

SESSION_ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('session_id',''))" 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$SESSION_ID" ] && exit 0

SHA=$(cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$SHA" ] && exit 0

CF_TOKEN="${SMOLFORGE_TOKEN:-$(git config --get smolforge.token 2>/dev/null)}"
CF_URL="${SMOLFORGE_URL:-$(git config --get smolforge.url 2>/dev/null || echo "https://forge.smol.ai")}"
REMOTE_URL=$(cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)
OWNER=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*/([^/]+)/([^/.]+)(\.git)?$|\1|')
REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*/([^/]+)/([^/.]+)(\.git)?$|\2|')

[ -z "$CF_TOKEN" ] || [ -z "$OWNER" ] || [ -z "$REPO" ] && exit 0

# Find session transcript file
SESSION_FILE=$(find ~/.claude/projects/ -name "$SESSION_ID.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SESSION_FILE" ] && exit 0

# Parse and upload (background to not block Claude)
(
python3 -c "
import json
messages = []
for line in open('$SESSION_FILE'):
    try: entry = json.loads(line)
    except: continue
    if entry.get('type') == 'human':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'user','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
    elif entry.get('type') == 'assistant':
        c = entry.get('message',{}).get('content','')
        if isinstance(c, list): c = ' '.join(x.get('text','') for x in c if isinstance(x,dict) and x.get('type')=='text')
        if c: messages.append({'role':'assistant','content':c,'timestamp':entry.get('timestamp','')})
print(json.dumps({'session_id':'$SESSION_ID','agent_type':'claude-code','commit_sha':'$SHA','messages':messages}))
" | curl -s -X POST "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/transcripts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- > /dev/null 2>&1
) &

exit 0
```

```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/smolforge-transcript.sh
```

**How it works**: Claude Code fires `PostToolUse` after every Bash tool call. The `if: "Bash(git commit *)"` condition ensures the hook only runs when the command was a git commit. The hook reads the session ID from stdin JSON, finds the transcript file, and uploads it in the background.

**Note**: Claude Code does not yet have a dedicated `PostCommit` event (see [github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4834](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4834)), so we use `PostToolUse` with a Bash matcher as the recommended workaround.

### Method 5: Codex CLI

OpenAI Codex CLI persists JSONL sessions under `~/.codex/sessions`. SmolForge supports Codex through the CLI-managed Git hook path:

```bash
sf hooks install <owner>/<repo> --agent codex --git post-commit,pre-push
```

The generated hook uploads the newest Codex JSONL with `agent_type` set to `"codex"` and the current commit SHA.

### Method 6: Cursor, Factory Droid, Devin, and OpenCode

For current CLI agents:

- Cursor CLI stores JSONL transcripts under `~/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/agent-transcripts/...`; SmolForge can discover those files and also installs a repo-local Cursor stop hook.
- Factory Droid stores JSONL sessions under `~/.factory/sessions/...` and its hook payload includes `session_id` and `transcript_path`; SmolForge installs a `SessionEnd` hook.
- Devin for Terminal stores sessions in SQLite at `~/.local/share/devin/cli/sessions.db` on current builds, with older installs under `~/.config/devin/cli/sessions.db`; SmolForge installs a `SessionEnd` hook and extracts a JSONL view when `sqlite3` is available.
- OpenCode current builds store sessions in SQLite under `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode*.db`; SmolForge uses the Git backstop and extracts a JSONL view when `sqlite3` is available. Older JSON transcript stores are also scanned when present.

### How to Add the AI-Session Trailer to Commits

When committing from an AI agent session, include the trailer in the commit message:

```bash
# Claude Code — find session ID from the JSONL filename
SESSION_ID=$(ls -t ~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs basename | sed 's/.jsonl//')

git commit -m "Implement feature X

AI-Session: $SESSION_ID
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

The trailer must be in the commit message body (after a blank line from the subject), formatted as `Key: Value`. Git trailers survive rebases, cherry-picks, and format-patch.

### For Other Agents

The transcript format is agent-agnostic. Set `agent_type` to identify the source:

```json
{
  "session_id": "any-unique-id",
  "agent_type": "codex",
  "commit_sha": "...",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Fix the login bug", "timestamp": "..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "I found the issue in auth.ts...", "timestamp": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Supported `agent_type` values (convention, not enforced): `claude-code`, `claude-cowork`, `codex`, `cursor`, `factory`, `devin`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `aider`, `continue`, `custom`.

### Uploading Images from Transcripts

If your agent session included screenshots or images:

```bash
# Upload image first
RESULT=$(curl -s -X POST "$CF_URL/api/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/transcripts/$SESSION_ID/images" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@screenshot.png")

IMAGE_KEY=$(echo "$RESULT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['key'])")

# Then include the key in the message's image_keys array
# { "role": "user", "content": "Here's the error", "image_keys": ["$IMAGE_KEY"] }
```

## Forge Wiki

Public repositories may expose an exact-commit Wiki:

```
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/wiki
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/wiki/pages/:slug
GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/wiki/search-index
```

Signed-in users can ask cited questions with:

```
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/wiki/ask
{ "question": "How does this repository handle authentication?" }
```

Forge also exposes a stateless Streamable HTTP MCP server at `POST /mcp/wiki`.
Its tools are `read_wiki_structure`, `read_wiki_contents`, and
`ask_question`. Public read tools need no token. `ask_question` requires a
personal access token with the `wiki:ask` scope.

Every Wiki response reports its pinned source SHA. Citation links use
`/:owner/:repo/blob/:sha/*`; Forge rejects stored commits that are not
reachable from the repository's current refs.

---

## Forge Repository Agents V1

Every repository exposes a durable, creator-private multi-turn agent thread API:

```text
GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/execution-profiles
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads
GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads
GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id
POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id/messages
GET  /api/repos/:owner/:repo/agent/threads/:thread_id/events?after=:cursor
```

Thread handles use `agent_thread_` followed by 32 lowercase hex characters.
If `thread_id` is omitted, Forge assigns and returns one. Messages and runs use
`agent_message_` and `agent_run_` handles with the same suffix rule.

The repository-agent API does not use `Idempotency-Key`. A connector that needs
exact retry safety may supply `client_message_id` for one message. The digest
also binds normalized input, source, and execution request. Reusing a thread is
a new conversational turn, not a duplicate request.

Personal access tokens use `agent:read`, `agent:message`, and `agent:run`,
optionally constrained to one repository. Repository-scoped agent service
principals provide separately rotatable API keys for bots and automation.

Instant is a real Worker-native, read-only agent over a deterministically
selected, bounded exact-SHA evidence set. It cannot execute code, run tests,
use tools or secrets, or write a branch. Agent-directed multi-round retrieval
belongs to Workspace. Workspace is adapter-ready but returns `backend_unavailable`
until its production dispatcher exists. Every terminal run exposes an immutable
metadata-only execution receipt. See `/docs/docs/repository-agent-v1` for the
complete contract.

## Health Check

```
GET /health
→ { "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-03-29T08:00:00.000Z" }
```
