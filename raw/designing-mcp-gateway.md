## Introduction

Uber’s rapid adoption of AI agents has fundamentally changed how teams interact with code, data, and operational systems. Early ad-hoc integrations with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) showed clear value: agents became dramatically more capable when they could access live business context, query internal services, and take meaningful actions on behalf of users. These early wins validated MCP as a powerful abstraction for building agentic systems inside Uber.

However, as adoption accelerated, significant challenges emerged. Individual teams independently built integrations, leading to fragmentation in tooling and duplicated infrastructure. MCP tools were hard to discover, difficult to operate reliably, and tightly coupled to specific services or agent implementations. While these approaches worked at a small scale, they didn’t meet Uber’s needs as hundreds of teams began exploring agentic workflows. Without a unified architecture, scaling MCP would increase operational complexity, security risk, and developer friction, ultimately limiting its impact.

To unlock MCP’s full potential at Uber’s scale, we needed a centralized, scalable solution to standardize how AI agents interact with existing back-end systems while preserving flexibility for teams. This solution needed to abstract protocol differences (HTTP, gRPC*™*, TChannel), enforce consistent security and observability guarantees, and make MCP tools easy to create, discover, and reuse across the company.

We built the MCP Gateway to address this need. It’s a foundational microservice that powers all MCP interactions at Uber, serving as an orchestration and routing layer between AI agents and existing back-end services and native MCP servers. By centralizing MCP logic into a single gateway, we provide a consistent execution model for agent-to-service interactions while eliminating the need for teams to reinvent core infrastructure. Existing APIs can be seamlessly exposed as MCP tools, governed and operated in one place, and consumed by multiple agents in a uniform way. MCP Gateway unlocked a scalable, fast, and consistent path to building AI agents within Uber and is currently hosting over 800 MCP servers and over 5000 tools.

### The Gateway

MCP Gateway follows a microservice-based architecture, with the gateway acting as the central integration point between AI-enabled systems and Uber’s back-end services. The platform comprises two primary components: the MCP Registry, which serves as the control plane, and the Proxy Gateway, which forms the data plane.

The MCP Registry maintains a catalog of hundreds of MCP servers backed by internal services, along with thousands of MCP tools. These tools range from no-code definitions that expose existing APIs as MCP tools to fully native implementations built explicitly against the MCP specification. The registry provides a single source of truth for discovery, ownership, and enablement across the ecosystem.

The Proxy Gateway is responsible for executing MCP requests at runtime. It translates MCP protocol calls into HTTP, gRPC, or TChannel requests, forwards them to the appropriate back-end service, and converts the responses back into MCP-compatible results. This translation layer allows AI agents to interact with existing systems through a consistent MCP interface, without requiring changes to the underlying services.

### Control Plane

Uber has a microservice architecture and operates with thousands of internal services that expose APIs over HTTP, gRPC, and TChannel. These APIs provide valuable context to an AI system, but asking teams to manually author an MCP server would be slow and painful. To solve this problem, we built AutoCrawler, which continuously scans Uber’s IDL registry for APIs, translates them, and updates them in the registry. It also queries native MCP servers and adds them to the registry.

#### AutoCrawler: Discovery Engine

Autocrawler is a Cadence-powered distributed workflow system subscribed to Uber’s IDL registry and internal service signals. On a fixed schedule, a cron job triggers a Cadence workflow that scans for newly added services, APIs, and schema changes.

For every discovered entity, AutoCrawler is responsible for:

- Creating or updating MCP server representations
- Generating or fetching tool definitions and schemas
- Registering tools in the MCP Registry in a disabled-by-default state

This shared foundation enables MCP discovery to scale across thousands of services while keeping service teams off the critical path.

#### Discovery for IDL-Backed Services

For traditional back-end services defined through Protobuf or Thrift IDLs, AutoCrawler derives MCP servers and tools directly from the IDL Registry. For each service:API group, AutoCrawler performs the following steps:

- **Upsert MCP server:**Creates or updates a virtual MCP server corresponding to the discovered service.
- **Parse IDL definitions:**Parses the associated protobuf or Thrift files to extract method names, request and response schemas, and documentation comments.
- **Generate tool descriptions:**Uses an LLM to generate enriched, agent-friendly MCP tool descriptions based on the extracted schemas and comments.
- **Schema translation:**Translates protobuf or Thrift schemas into MCP-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 schemas.
- **Upsert MCP tools:**Registers or updates the generated MCP tools in the MCP Registry in a disabled-by-default state.

#### Discovery for Native Servers

In addition to IDL-backed services, the MCP Gateway also supports native MCP servers—services that implement the MCP protocol directly and expose agent-optimized tools.

MCPFx is the framework Uber uses to build native MCP servers. Each native MCP server emits a heartbeat metric that signals its presence and readiness. AutoCrawler continuously monitors these heartbeat signals to automatically discover new native MCP servers. When a native MCP server is discovered, AutoCrawler follows a different discovery path:

- It makes a *listTools*call to the native MCP server to retrieve the tools it explicitly exposes, along with their schemas.
- It creates a virtual proxy MCP server in the MCP Registry that contains all discovered tools and their schemas, in a disabled-by-default state.

### 3P MCP Servers

The MCP Gateway serves as the centralized orchestration layer for all MCP interactions across Uber, extending seamless support to third-party integrations such as Jira and Google.

Provisioning third-party MCP servers relies on the co-operation of two key components:

- **MCP Gateway:**Relays the caller's user token downstream while enforcing essential gateway capabilities, including authorization, rate limiting, and sensitive data redaction.
- **Third-Party MCP Service:**Exchanges the internal user token for a corresponding third-party authentication token before dispatching the request to the external MCP server.

#### Authoring and Enablement

While we may create MCP servers without involving the service team, ownership and control of the MCP server must reside with the service team. A core design principle of the MCP Gateway is that discovery doesn’t imply exposure. Every MCP server and tool starts in a disabled state and must be explicitly reviewed and enabled by the owning team. Service owners can review and refine the generated tool definitions before enabling them.

Every change to the tool description triggers a config change diff, which must be approved by server owners. Owners can approve and deploy the config change, and, if needed, roll back to a previous known version.

#### Data Plane

The MCP Gateway data plane is the core runtime service responsible for executing MCP requests. It continuously consumes server and tool configurations from the control plane and refreshes its in-memory state at a fixed cadence, allowing configuration changes, such as tool updates or enablement changes, to take effect in real time without service restarts or redeployments.

Based on this configuration, the data plane dynamically materializes virtual MCP servers. For each virtual server, the Gateway exposes a single */<service-name>/mcp* endpoint that serves as the entry point for AI agent execution. Incoming requests are resolved to their corresponding server handlers through a built-in proxy server.

#### Protocol Translation and Execution

Protocol translation in the MCP Gateway is handled by server handlers within the Proxy Gateway. Each server handler is tool-aware and downstream-aware, allowing it to correctly route and execute MCP requests at runtime.

#### Security

MCP Gateway provides built-in authorization and redaction for all servers at tool-level granularity. MCP gateway uses Uber’s internal Access Control System to apply different charter policies configured on detected caller actors (humans, services, and agents). Charter policies are created at the server level with optional tool-level overrides if required.

MCP Gateway also does out-of-the-box redaction for any PII or sensitive data from the tool responses.

#### IDL-Backed Downstream Services

For tools backed by existing back-end services, the server handler maintains an in-memory mapping that describes the downstream destination, such as HTTP endpoint config or gRPC/TChannel procedures.

When an MCP request arrives, the handler:

- Translates the incoming JSON payload into the appropriate wire format.
- Serializes the request into Protobuf or Thrift bytes.
- Forwards the request to the downstream service.
- Translates the Protobuf or Thrift byte responses back to MCP-compatible JSON, and returns to the calling agent.

The actual downstream request is executed via Muttley, Uber’s service mesh sidecar that runs alongside all back-end services. By delegating request execution to Muttley, the MCP Gateway automatically benefits from existing service-to-service routing capabilities.

#### Native MCP Servers

Native MCP servers are also registered as virtual servers in the MCP registry, which acts as a proxy to the original server. At runtime, native MCP requests are transparently proxied to the downstream server and responses are proxied back to the caller.

### Benefits of the Gateway

By building the MCP-Gateway, Uber has achieved a scalable and unified approach towards building agentic systems, with most impactful benefits coming from:

- Easy discovery and installation
- No-code approach towards existing APIs
- Built-in observability and security
- Centralized ownership and governance

## Extending the Gateway

Scaling MCP Gateway to hundreds of servers and thousands of tools revealed problems that don’t exist at small scale. Context Bloat and Excessive Cost

### Runtime Discovery

MCP has no native concept of cross-server search. An agent has to already know which server to talk to before it can ask what tools are available. Configuring an agent to use an MCP server requires explicitly wiring up the server URL, credentials, and tool list. Doing this for hundreds of servers doesn’t scale, as all this context would eat up the model context limit. We solved this problem with the following

- **Omni MCP**- A single proxy server that allows MCP clients to access any of the MCP Gateway’s servers with a gradual discovery pattern, which also unlocks context/token optimization via incremental discovery. Omni MCP exposes these tools.
- **discover_server**- discover MCP server based on the query intent
- **discover_tools**- lookup tools for a server
- **get_tool_schema**- get the json schema for a tool
- **invoke_tool**- invoke a tool
 

Together, these tools enable incremental discovery and access to all MCP servers, with built-in access control and the rest of the gateway features.

- **Response Projection -**MCP Gateway also offers Response Projection, a GraphQL-like calling pattern for MCP tools. It works by injecting a new field in the tool request schema, which instructs the gateway to request only the needed fields, not all. The LLM reads and injects the fields with an array of nested paths of only required fields. The Gateway then trims the response in runtime by only keeping the projected fields. This has allowed us to scale the API schema compatibility for MCP at the enterprise level.
- **Code Mode**- Coding agents often operate in shell environments where writing tool output directly to files is more efficient than loading full responses into model context. Code Mode serves this pattern through aifx, Uber's CLI for agentic operations, routing MCP calls through the gateway without requiring any MCP server to be installed. It helps agents discover correct MCP tools for the job without the MCP definition being present in context. aifx exposes three commands:
- aifx mcp list - list available MCP servers
- aifx mcp search - search for tools across all MCP servers
- aifx mcp call - invoke an MCP tool through MCP Gateway
 

Agents can chain these in a single command and write output to files, which filesystem agents grep selectively, loading only what they need into context. Code Mode is now the company default for MCP tool use in coding agents.

### Conclusion

Building the MCP Gateway has fundamentally changed how AI agents operate at Uber. What began as a fragmentation problem, with dozens of teams independently wiring up MCP integrations with inconsistent tooling, no shared security guarantees, and duplicated infrastructure, is now a unified, scalable platform that any team can plug into in minutes.

The core insight driving our design was simple: existing APIs are the fastest way to provide tools to an agent. Rather than asking teams to rewrite their services for an agentic world, MCP Gateway meets them where they are—translating HTTP, gRPC, and TChannel calls into MCP-compatible interactions transparently, through Muttley, with zero changes to downstream services.

If you’re building agentic systems at scale, the hardest part isn’t the AI. It’s building the connective tissue—the discovery, the security, the reliability that makes agents trustworthy enough to act on behalf of real users in a production environment. MCP Gateway is our answer to that challenge, and we hope the design decisions documented here are useful to others facing the same problem.
