A sandbox control plane for managing isolated execution environments across multiple backends.

Running untrusted or experimental code safely requires strong isolation — but the tooling to manage that isolation is fragmented. Incus gives you system containers, Firecracker gives you microVMs, and each has its own API, lifecycle model, and operational quirks.

Navaris provides a single control plane that abstracts over these backends. You get a unified REST API and CLI for creating, snapshotting, and managing sandboxes regardless of whether they run as containers or microVMs. The same workflow that creates an Incus container also works for a Firecracker VM — same endpoints, same state machine, same tooling.

This matters when you need to:

- **Offer on-demand dev environments**where users shouldn't care about the underlying runtime
- **Run untrusted code**with microVM-level isolation without rewriting your orchestration layer
- **Snapshot and restore**execution state for reproducibility or checkpointing
- **Mix isolation levels**— containers for speed, microVMs for security — behind one API

Navaris supports two isolation backends. You can enable one or both when starting the daemon — the API and CLI work identically regardless of which backend is running underneath. When both are enabled, each sandbox is routed to the correct backend automatically.

Incus runs sandboxes as system containers using LXC. Containers share the host kernel but get their own filesystem, process tree, and network namespace.

**Strengths:**

- **Fast startup**— containers launch in under a second
- **Low overhead**— no guest kernel, near-native CPU and memory performance
- **Mature ecosystem**— rich image library, live migration, storage pools, and clustering built in
- **Simpler operations**— no kernel or rootfs images to manage separately

**Best for:** development environments, CI runners, trusted workloads where speed and density matter more than hard isolation boundaries.

Firecracker runs sandboxes as lightweight virtual machines using KVM. Each sandbox gets its own guest kernel, providing hardware-level isolation.

**Strengths:**

- **Strong isolation**— separate kernel per sandbox; a guest kernel exploit doesn't compromise the host
- **Minimal attack surface**— Firecracker's VMM is purpose-built with a small device model (no PCI, no USB, no graphics)
- **Predictable performance**— dedicated vCPUs and memory with no kernel sharing; no noisy-neighbor effects from cgroup contention
- **Jailer integration**— each VM runs in a chroot with seccomp filters and a dedicated UID

**Best for:** running untrusted code, multi-tenant environments, security-sensitive workloads where isolation guarantees matter.

| Consideration | Incus | Firecracker | 
|---|---|---|
| Startup time | ~1s | ~2-3s | 
| Memory overhead | Minimal | ~30MB per VM (guest kernel) | 
| Isolation level | Namespace/cgroup | Hardware (KVM) | 
| Host kernel shared | Yes | No | 
| Requires `/dev/kvm` | No | Yes | 
| Image management | Built-in image server | Manual rootfs + kernel | 
| Live snapshots | Native support | Memory + disk snapshot | 
| Density (sandboxes per host) | Higher | Lower | 

You can run both backends in a single Navaris instance — containers for speed, microVMs for security — behind one API. Backend selection happens automatically based on image format, or you can specify it explicitly per sandbox.

- **Multi-backend**: Incus (system containers) and Firecracker (microVMs)
- **Full lifecycle management**: create, start, stop, destroy sandboxes
- **Runtime resize**: change CPU and/or memory limits on a running sandbox via- `PATCH /v1/sandboxes/{id}/resources`(Incus: live cgroup writes; Firecracker: CPU enforced via cgroup CPU bandwidth (- `cpu.max`) within the boot-time ceiling, memory via balloon adjustment — by default sandboxes can SHRINK memory; set- `--firecracker-mem-headroom-mult > 1.0`/- `--firecracker-vcpu-headroom-mult > 1.0`to allow GROW-resize within the boot-time ceiling)
- **Time-bounded boost**: temporarily raise CPU/memory for a fixed duration via- `POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/boost`; the daemon auto-reverts at expiry (with retry-on-failure). FC CPU is enforced via cgroup CPU bandwidth (- `cpu.max`); FC memory via virtio-balloon. One active boost per sandbox; auto-cancelled if the sandbox stops or is destroyed. Cap with- `--boost-max-duration`(default 1h, max 24h).
- **In-sandbox boost channel**: guest code can request its own boost via- `POST /boost`on- `/var/run/navaris-guest.sock`inside the sandbox. Implicitly authenticated (channel == sandbox identity), per-sandbox token-bucket rate-limited (1 rps, burst 10), opt-in/opt-out per sandbox (- `enable_boost_channel`) with daemon-default flag- `--boost-channel-enabled`(default true). See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-in-sandbox-boost-channel-design.md.
- **Snapshots**: point-in-time captures (stopped and live consistency modes)
- **Images**: promote snapshots into reusable base images
- **Copy-on-write cloning**: rootfs clones via- `ioctl(FICLONE)`on btrfs / XFS-reflink / bcachefs hosts — see docs/storage-backends.md
- **Memory CoW fork**(Firecracker): spawn N children from a running parent in well under a second per child via- `mmap(MAP_PRIVATE)`of a shared snapshot — see docs/sandbox-fork.md
- **Interactive sessions**: persistent, reconnectable shell sessions (direct and tmux-backed)
- **Command execution**: run commands inside sandboxes with PTY support
- **Port forwarding**: publish sandbox ports to the host
- **Async operations**: long-running tasks with progress tracking and cancellation
- **Real-time events**: WebSocket event stream for sandbox lifecycle changes
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry metrics and distributed tracing (OTLP export)
- **Projects**: organize sandboxes into logical groups
- **MCP server**: expose sandboxes as Model Context Protocol tools for AI agents — see docs/mcp.md

For Firecracker, a lightweight guest agent (`navaris-agent`) runs inside each VM and communicates with the daemon over vsock for command execution and session management.

The fastest way to try Navaris is the prebuilt all-in-one image on Docker Hub:

```
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --device /dev/kvm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  erans/navaris:latest
```
The image bundles both backends (Incus + Firecracker), the embedded Web UI, and a Firecracker-compatible kernel. Multi-arch — `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are both published.

Key flags:

- `--privileged`is required for Incus (cgroup setup, network namespace mounts) and the Firecracker jailer.
- `--device /dev/kvm`is required for Firecracker. Omit it if you only want to use Incus; Firecracker will be disabled at startup with a warning.
- `-p 8080:8080`exposes the REST API and Web UI. Pair with- `--auth-token`(set inside the container) when exposing the port beyond localhost.

Pin to a specific release for reproducibility:

```
docker run --rm -it --privileged --device /dev/kvm -p 8080:8080 \
  erans/navaris:v0.1.0
```
Available tags are listed at https://hub.docker.com/r/erans/navaris/tags. The image is built from the top-level `Dockerfile` by the `Publish Docker image` GitHub Actions workflow on each tagged release.

- Go 1.26+
- For Incus backend: a running Incus daemon
- For Firecracker backend: Firecracker binary, jailer, a Linux kernel, and `/dev/kvm`access

For native Linux installs with `systemd`, release packaging notes live in
docs/native-install.md.

Release tarballs also include `scripts/install-native.sh` for direct host
installation.

# With Incus only
./navarisd --incus-socket /var/lib/incus/unix.socket --auth-token mysecret
# With Firecracker only (requires /dev/kvm)
./navarisd \
  --firecracker-bin /usr/local/bin/firecracker \

  --kernel-path /var/lib/firecracker/vmlinux \
  --image-dir /var/lib/firecracker/images \
  --auth-token mysecret
# Both backends simultaneously
./navarisd \
  --incus-socket /var/lib/incus/unix.socket \

  --jailer-bin /usr/local/bin/jailer \
  --kernel-path /var/lib/firecracker/vmlinux \
  --image-dir /var/lib/firecracker/images \
  --auth-token mysecret
```
When both `--incus-socket` and `--firecracker-bin` are provided, navarisd enables both backends. If KVM is not available, Firecracker is disabled with a warning and Incus continues to work.

Backend selection for new sandboxes follows this priority:

- Explicit `backend`field in the API request
- Auto-detection from image reference: `alpine/3.21`(slash) -> Incus,`alpine-3.21`(flat) -> Firecracker
- Default fallback: Incus (when both are available)

| Flag | Default | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| `--listen` | `:8080` | Address to listen on |

| `--log-level` | `info` | Log level (debug, info, warn, error) | 
| `--auth-token` | (empty) | Bearer token for API auth (empty = no auth) | 
| `--incus-socket` | Path to Incus unix socket | |

Navaris ships with an optional web UI for inspecting projects, sandboxes, and events, triggering lifecycle actions, and attaching to sandbox terminals. It is disabled by default.

Pass `--ui-password` to `navarisd`:

`navarisd --ui-password "$(openssl rand -base64 24)" --auth-token your-token`The UI is served from the root of the listen address. Visit `http://HOST:8080/`, sign in with the password, and you're in. API endpoints for the UI itself live under `/ui/` (`/ui/login`, `/ui/logout`, `/ui/me`) and are not meant to be visited directly.

| Flag | Env var | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| `--ui-password` | `NAVARIS_UI_PASSWORD` | Password required to sign in. Leaving it unset disables the UI entirely. | 
| `--ui-session-key` | `NAVARIS_UI_SESSION_KEY` | Base64-encoded 32-byte key used to sign session cookies. Auto-generated at startup if omitted — existing sessions are invalidated on every restart in that case. | 
| `--ui-session-ttl` | `NAVARIS_UI_SESSION_TTL` | How long a session cookie is valid (default `24h`). | 

- The UI does **not**support TLS termination itself. Put it behind a reverse proxy in any environment where network traffic can be observed.
- Login attempts are rate-limited to 5 failures per IP per minute.
- Session cookies are HMAC-signed, `HttpOnly`,`SameSite=Lax`, and flagged`Secure`when the request arrives over HTTPS.

`make web-deps web-build build-ui`The SPA sources live in `web/`. See `web/MANUAL_TERMINAL_SMOKE.md` for a manual smoke-test procedure.

Navaris exposes its API as a Model Context Protocol server so AI agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and other MCP clients) can manage sandboxes as tools. 22 tools cover the full lifecycle: projects, sandboxes, sessions, snapshots, images, and operations.

Two transports are supported:

- **Stdio binary**(- `navaris-mcp`) — connects to a remote- `navarisd`over HTTP. Configure with- `NAVARIS_API_URL`and- `NAVARIS_TOKEN`. Best for local agent setups (e.g. Claude Desktop config).
- **Embedded HTTP endpoint**— mount inside- `navarisd`itself with- `--mcp-enabled`. Bearer-only auth via- `--auth-token`. Best for remote agents or self-hosted control planes.

```
# Embedded mode — same listener as the REST API
./navarisd --auth-token mysecret --mcp-enabled
# /v1/mcp now accepts MCP requests with Authorization: Bearer mysecret
# Read-only mode hides every mutating tool
./navarisd --auth-token mysecret --mcp-enabled --mcp-read-only
```

Security:Running`--mcp-enabled`without`--auth-token`exposes mutating tools to unauthenticated requests; the daemon logs a warning at startup when this combination is detected.

See docs/mcp.md for the full tool catalog, env-var reference, and per-tool argument schemas.

Navaris ships a Claude Code skill pack (`navaris-cli`) so you can ask Claude Code in plain English to drive the CLI for you — "spin up an alpine sandbox and run my tests", "snapshot this sandbox before I upgrade it". Install with:

```
/plugin marketplace add erans/navaris
/plugin install navaris-cli@navaris
```
See docs/claude-skills.md for the full skill list, install/uninstall, and MCP-vs-skill tradeoffs.

Configure the CLI via flags or environment variables:

```
export NAVARIS_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
export NAVARIS_TOKEN=mysecret
```
```
