**One CLI for all of Google Workspace — built for humans and AI agents.**

Drive, Gmail, Calendar, and every Workspace API. Zero boilerplate. Structured JSON output. 40+ agent skills included.

Note

This is **not** an officially supported Google product.

⬇️ **Download the latest release for your OS**

`gws` doesn't ship a static list of commands. It reads Google's own Discovery Service at runtime and builds its entire command surface dynamically. When Google Workspace adds an API endpoint or method, `gws` picks it up automatically.

Important

This project is under active development. Expect breaking changes as we march toward v1.0.

- **Node.js 18+**— for- `npm install`(or download a pre-built binary from GitHub Releases)
- **A Google Cloud project**— required for OAuth credentials. You can create one via the Google Cloud Console or with the- `gcloud`CLI or with the- `gws auth setup`command.
- **A Google account**with access to Google Workspace

The recommended way to install `gws` is to download the pre-built binary for your OS and architecture from the **GitHub Releases** page. Extract the archive and place the `gws` binary in your `$PATH`.

For convenience, you can also use `npm` to automate downloading the appropriate binary from GitHub Releases:

`npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli`Or build from source:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli --locked`A Nix flake is also available at `github:googleworkspace/cli`

`nix run github:googleworkspace/cli`On macOS and Linux, you can also install via Homebrew:

`brew install googleworkspace-cli````
gws auth setup     # walks you through Google Cloud project config
gws auth login     # subsequent OAuth login
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 5}'
```
**For humans** — stop writing `curl` calls against REST docs. `gws` gives you `--help` on every resource, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and auto‑pagination.

**For AI agents** — every response is structured JSON. Pair it with the included agent skills and your LLM can manage Workspace without custom tooling.

```
# List the 10 most recent files
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 10}'
# Create a spreadsheet
gws sheets spreadsheets create --json '{"properties": {"title": "Q1 Budget"}}'
# Send a Chat message
gws chat spaces messages create \
  --params '{"parent": "spaces/xyz"}' \
  --json '{"text": "Deploy complete."}' \
  --dry-run
# Introspect any method's request/response schema
gws schema drive.files.list
# Stream paginated results as NDJSON
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 100}' --page-all | jq -r '.files[].name'
```
The CLI supports multiple auth workflows so it works on your laptop, in CI, and on a server.

| I have… | Use | 
|---|---|
| `gcloud`installed and authenticated | `gws auth setup`(fastest) | 
| A GCP project but no `gcloud` | Manual OAuth setup | 
| An existing OAuth access token | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` | 
| Existing Credentials | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | 

Credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) with the key stored in your OS keyring (or `~/.config/gws/.encryption_key` when `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file`).

```
gws auth setup       # one-time: creates a Cloud project, enables APIs, logs you in
gws auth login       # subsequent scope selection and login
```

`gws auth setup`requires the`gcloud`CLI. If you don't have`gcloud`, use the manual setup below instead.

Warning

**Scope limits in testing mode:** If your OAuth app is unverified (testing mode),
Google limits consent to ~25 scopes. The `recommended` scope preset includes 85+
scopes and **will fail** for unverified apps (especially for `@gmail.com` accounts).
Choose individual services instead to filter the scope picker:

`gws auth login -s drive,gmail,sheets`Use this when `gws auth setup` cannot automate project/client creation, or when you want explicit control.

- Open Google Cloud Console in the target project:
- OAuth consent screen: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
- Credentials: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
 
- OAuth consent screen: 
- Configure OAuth branding/audience if prompted:
- App type: **External**(testing mode is fine)
 
- App type: 
- Add your account under **Test users**
- Create an OAuth client:
- Type: **Desktop app**
 
- Type: 
- Download the client JSON and save it to:
- `~/.config/gws/client_secret.json`
 

Important

**You must add yourself as a test user.** In the OAuth consent screen, click
**Test users → Add users** and enter your Google account email. Without this,
login will fail with a generic "Access blocked" error.

Then run:

`gws auth login`You can complete OAuth either manually or with browser automation.

- **Human flow**: run- `gws auth login`, open the printed URL, approve scopes.
- **Agent-assisted flow**: the agent opens the URL, selects account, handles consent prompts, and returns control once the localhost callback succeeds.

If consent shows **"Google hasn't verified this app"** (testing mode), click **Continue**.
If scope checkboxes appear, select required scopes (or **Select all**) before continuing.

- Complete interactive auth on a machine with a browser.
- Export credentials:
gws auth export --unmasked > credentials.json 
- On the headless machine:
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json gws drive files list # just works 

Point to your key file; no login needed.

```
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/service-account.json
gws drive files list
```
Useful when another tool (e.g. `gcloud`) already mints tokens for your environment.

`export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)`| Priority | Source | Set via | 
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Access token | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` | 
| 2 | Credentials file | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | 
| 3 | Encrypted credentials | `gws auth login` | 
| 4 | Plaintext credentials | `~/.config/gws/credentials.json` | 

Environment variables can also live in a `.env` file.

The repo ships 100+ Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` files) — one for every supported API, plus higher-level helpers for common workflows and 50 curated recipes for Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, and Sheets. See the full Skills Index for the complete list.

```
# Install all skills at once
npx skills add https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli
# Or pick only what you need
npx skills add https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/tree/main/skills/gws-drive
npx skills add https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/tree/main/skills/gws-gmail
```
## OpenClaw setup

```
# Symlink all skills (stays in sync with repo)
ln -s $(pwd)/skills/gws-* ~/.openclaw/skills/
# Or copy specific skills
cp -r skills/gws-drive skills/gws-gmail ~/.openclaw/skills/
```
The `gws-shared` skill includes an `install` block so OpenClaw auto-installs the CLI via `npm` if `gws` isn't on PATH.

- 
Authenticate the CLI first: gws auth setup 
- 
Install the extension into the Gemini CLI: gemini extensions install https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli 

Installing this extension gives your Gemini CLI agent direct access to all `gws` commands and Google Workspace agent skills. Because `gws` handles its own authentication securely, you simply need to authenticate your terminal once prior to using the agent, and the extension will automatically inherit your credentials.

`gws drive files create --json '{"name": "report.pdf"}' --upload ./report.pdf`| Flag | Description | Default | 
|---|---|---|
| `--page-all` | Auto-paginate, one JSON line per page (NDJSON) | off | 
| `--page-limit <N>` | Max pages to fetch | 10 | 
| `--page-delay <MS>` | Delay between pages | 100 ms | 

Sheets ranges use `!` which bash interprets as history expansion. Always wrap values in **single quotes**:

```
# Read cells A1:C10 from "Sheet1"
gws sheets spreadsheets values get \
  --params '{"spreadsheetId": "SPREADSHEET_ID", "range": "Sheet1!A1:C10"}'
# Append rows
gws sheets spreadsheets values append \
  --params '{"spreadsheetId": "ID", "range": "Sheet1!A1", "valueInputOption": "USER_ENTERED"}' \
  --json '{"values": [["Name", "Score"], ["Alice", 95]]}'
```
Some services ship hand-crafted helper commands alongside the auto-generated Discovery surface. Helper commands are prefixed with `+` so they are visually distinct and never collide with Discovery-generated method names.

Time-aware helpers (`+agenda`, `+standup-report`, `+weekly-digest`, `+meeting-prep`) automatically use your **Google account timezone** (fetched from Calendar Settings API and cached for 24 hours). Override with `--timezone`/`--tz` on `+agenda`, or set the `--timezone` flag for explicit control.

Run `gws <service> --help` to see both Discovery methods and helper commands together.

```
gws gmail --help      # shows +send, +reply, +reply-all, +forward, +triage, +watch …
gws calendar --help   # shows +insert, +agenda …
gws drive --help      # shows +upload …
```

Environment variables can also be set in a `.env` file (loaded via dotenvy).

`gws` uses structured exit codes so scripts can branch on the failure type without parsing error output.

| Code | Meaning | Example cause | 
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Success | Command completed normally | 
| `1` | API error | Google returned a 4xx/5xx response | 
| `2` | Auth error | Credentials missing, expired, or invalid | 
| `3` | Validation error | Bad arguments, unknown service, invalid flag | 
| `4` | Discovery error | Could not fetch the API schema document | 
| `5` | Internal error | Unexpected failure | 

```
gws drive files list --params '{"fileId": "bad"}'
echo $?   # 1 — API error
gws unknown-service files list
echo $?   # 3 — validation error (unknown service)
```
`gws` uses a **two-phase parsing** strategy:

- Read `argv[1]`to identify the service (e.g.`drive`)
- Fetch the service's Discovery Document (cached 24 h)
- Build a `clap::Command`tree from the document's resources and methods
- Re-parse the remaining arguments
- Authenticate, build the HTTP request, execute

All output — success, errors, download metadata — is structured JSON.

Your OAuth app is in **testing mode** and your account is not listed as a test user.

**Fix:** Open the OAuth consent screen in your GCP project → **Test users** → **Add users** → enter your Google account email. Then retry `gws auth login`.

Expected when your app is in testing mode. Click **Advanced** → **Go to <app name> (unsafe)** to proceed. This is safe for personal use; verification is only required to publish the app to other users.

Unverified (testing mode) apps are limited to ~25 OAuth scopes. The `recommended` scope preset includes many scopes and will exceed this limit.

**Fix:** Select only the scopes you need:

`gws auth login --scopes drive,gmail,calendar``gws auth setup` requires the `gcloud` CLI to automate project creation. You have three options:

- Install gcloud and use `gcloud`directly.
- Re-run `gws auth setup`which wraps`gcloud`calls.
- Skip `gcloud`entirely — set up OAuth credentials manually in the Cloud Console

The OAuth client was not created as a **Desktop app** type. In the Credentials page, delete the existing client, create a new one with type **Desktop app**, and download the new JSON.

If a required Google API is not enabled for your GCP project, you will see a
403 error with reason `accessNotConfigured`:

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Gmail API has not been used in project 549352339482 ...",
    "reason": "accessNotConfigured",
    "enable_url": "https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482"
  }
}
```
`gws` also prints an actionable hint to **stderr**:

```
💡 API not enabled for your GCP project.
   Enable it at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482
   After enabling, wait a few seconds and retry your command.
```
**Steps to fix:**

- Click the `enable_url`link (or copy it from the`enable_url`JSON field).
- In the GCP Console, click **Enable**.
- Wait ~10 seconds, then retry your `gws`command.

Tip

You can also run `gws auth setup` which walks you through enabling all required
APIs for your project automatically.

```
cargo build                       # dev build
cargo clippy -- -D warnings       # lint
cargo test                        # unit tests
./scripts/coverage.sh             # HTML coverage report → target/llvm-cov/html/
```
Apache-2.0
