**Agentic spec builder** — an event-sourced specification management tool with an AI agent swarm and a real-time web UI.

barnstormer helps you build software specifications collaboratively with AI. You describe what you want to build, and a swarm of specialized agents brainstorm ideas, organize plans, identify risks, and generate architecture diagrams — all in real time through an interactive web interface.

```
# From GitHub (requires Rust toolchain)
cargo install --git https://github.com/2389-research/barnstormer
# Or clone and build
git clone https://github.com/2389-research/barnstormer.git
cd barnstormer
cargo build --release
```
Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Windows are available on the Releases page.

A native macOS wrapper now lives in `crates/barnstormer-tauri/`. It launches Barnstormer's existing Axum UI in an embedded local runtime and stores desktop data under macOS Application Support instead of assuming a terminal-managed `.env`.

Build the app bundle with:

`cargo tauri build --bundles app --config crates/barnstormer-tauri/tauri.conf.json`The desktop setup flow opens a native settings window first if no provider key is configured, then launches the main Barnstormer window after saving at least one provider key. More detail is in docs/desktop-app.md. For release-grade macOS signing and the required GitHub secret contract, see docs/release-signing-secrets.md.

```
# Configure at least one LLM provider
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, or GEMINI_API_KEY
# Start the server (opens browser automatically)
barnstormer start
# Or start without opening a browser
barnstormer start --no-open
# Check if barnstormer is running
barnstormer status
# Import a spec from any file (DOT, YAML, markdown, plain text)
barnstormer import path/to/file.md
barnstormer import design.dot --format dot
barnstormer import --text "Build a CLI task manager"
cat notes.txt | barnstormer import -
```
The server runs at http://127.0.0.1:7331 by default.

Four crates in a Cargo workspace, plus a binary entrypoint:

| Crate | Path | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|
| barnstormer-core | `crates/barnstormer-core/` | Domain types, commands, events, state reducer, actor, exporters (Markdown, YAML, DOT) | 
| barnstormer-store | `crates/barnstormer-store/` | Persistence: JSONL event log, snapshots, SQLite index, crash recovery | 
| barnstormer-server | `crates/barnstormer-server/` | Axum HTTP API, SSE streaming, Askama+HTMX web UI, auth middleware | 
| barnstormer-agent | `crates/barnstormer-agent/` | Agent runtime, LLM provider adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini), swarm orchestrator | 

Binary entrypoint: `src/main.rs`

All mutations flow through event sourcing:

```
Command → SpecActor → Event → SpecState (in-memory)
                         │
                         ├─→ JSONL log (durable)
                         ├─→ SQLite index (queryable cache)
                         └─→ SSE broadcast (real-time UI)
```
State is materialized by replaying events through a reducer. The JSONL log is the source of truth; SQLite serves as a queryable cache. On startup, barnstormer recovers all specs from persisted events.

The `SwarmOrchestrator` runs a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate on your spec. Each agent has its own event receiver and a focused role:

| Role | Description | 
|---|---|
| Manager | Primary point of contact. Parses your description into structured fields, creates initial cards, asks clarifying questions, and coordinates the other agents. Prioritizes responding to human messages. | 
| Brainstormer | Generates creative ideas and explores possibilities. Creates idea cards with breadth-first exploration and narrates its thought process. | 
| Planner | Organizes ideas into structured, actionable plans. Moves promising ideas to the Plan lane, creates task cards, and updates constraints and success criteria. | 
| DotGenerator | Analyzes spec structure and card relationships. Identifies gaps (ideas without plans, plans without tasks), suggests structural improvements, and summarizes pipeline health. Does not create cards. | 
| Critic(available, not in default swarm) | Reviews the spec for gaps, inconsistencies, and risks. Creates risk and constraint cards and asks users about ambiguities. | 

The default swarm runs 4 agents (Manager, Brainstormer, Planner, DotGenerator). The Critic role is defined and available but not activated by default.

Agents communicate through 7 tools:

- **read_state**— Read current spec state summary
- **write_commands**— Submit spec-mutating commands (create/update/move/delete cards, update spec core)
- **emit_narration**— Post reasoning to the activity feed
- **emit_diff_summary**— Mark a step as finished with a change summary
- **ask_user_boolean**/- **ask_user_multiple_choice**/- **ask_user_freeform**— Ask the user questions (CAS-protected to prevent concurrent questions)

The UI is built with Askama templates, HTMX, and SSE for real-time updates without full page reloads.

**Layout:**

- **Nav rail**(left) — Spec list, provider status, new spec button, import button
- **Command bar**(top) — Spec title, view toggles, agent controls (start/pause/resume), undo
- **Canvas**(center) — Swappable views:- **Document**— Auto-generated markdown from spec data
- **Board**— Kanban-style drag-and-drop lanes with SortableJS
- **Diagram**— DOT graph rendered with Viz.js
 
- **Chat rail**(right) — Conversation transcript, question cards, and message input
- **Agent LEDs**— Colored status indicators showing which agents are running, paused, or stopped

SSE events (card changes, transcript updates, agent status) trigger HTMX partial re-renders to keep the UI in sync.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

| Variable | Default | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| `BARNSTORMER_HOME` | `~/.barnstormer` | Data directory for event logs, snapshots, and SQLite index | 
| `BARNSTORMER_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:7331` | Listen address | 
| `BARNSTORMER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | derived from `BARNSTORMER_BIND` | Public base URL | 
| `BARNSTORMER_AUTH_TOKEN` | (none) | Bearer token for API auth (optional, enables auth middleware) | 
| `BARNSTORMER_ALLOW_REMOTE` | `false` | Allow non-loopback connections (requires auth token) | 
| `BARNSTORMER_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` | (auto-detect) | LLM provider: `anthropic`,`openai`, or`gemini` | 
| `BARNSTORMER_DEFAULT_MODEL` | (provider default) | Model override (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) | 
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Anthropic API key | 
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | — | Anthropic API proxy URL (optional) | 
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI API key | 
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | — | OpenAI API proxy URL (optional) | 
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | Gemini API key | 
| `GEMINI_BASE_URL` | — | Gemini API proxy URL (optional) | 

Specs can be exported in three formats:

- **Markdown**— Human-readable document with spec details and cards organized by lane
- **YAML**— Structured data export of the full spec state
- **DOT**— Graphviz diagram source showing card relationships and flow

Export via the web UI (`/web/specs/{id}/export/markdown|yaml|dot`) or the API.

| Method | Path | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check | 
| `GET` | `/api/specs` | List all specs | 
| `POST` | `/api/specs` | Create a new spec | 
| `GET` | `/api/specs/{id}/state` | Get full spec state | 
| `POST` | `/api/specs/{id}/commands` | Submit commands | 
| `POST` | `/api/specs/{id}/undo` | Undo last command | 
| `GET` | `/api/specs/{id}/events/stream` | SSE event stream | 

When `BARNSTORMER_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, API routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Subscribe to `/api/specs/{id}/events/stream` for real-time updates:

`spec_created`, `spec_core_updated`, `card_created`, `card_updated`, `card_moved`, `card_deleted`, `transcript_appended`, `question_asked`, `question_answered`, `agent_step_started`, `agent_step_finished`, `undo_applied`, `snapshot_written`

```
# Run all tests
cargo test --all
# Run with clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
Tests cover domain logic, persistence, crash recovery, API routes, auth middleware, SSE streaming, agent tools, swarm orchestration, and an integration smoke test (`tests/smoke.rs`).

```
- All code files start with a 2-line `ABOUTME:`comment describing the file's purpose
- IDs use **ULID**(universally unique, lexicographically sortable)
- All mutations go through event sourcing: Command → Event → State
- Commands use `#[serde(tag = "type")]`— agents must produce`{"type": "CreateCard", ...}`
- Broadcast channel (4096 capacity) for event distribution
- Question handling uses CAS (compare-and-swap) to prevent concurrent agent questions
