# WinUI agents and skills for Windows app development

An [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) package with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex compatibility for building native Windows apps with **WinUI 3** and the **Windows App SDK**. It covers the end-to-end inner loop: scaffold → design → build → run → test → package → ship.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d25afc-ba15-4d8a-8dcf-2dd78000f3aa" />


> [!WARNING]
> **🚧 Preview · v0.x — expect breaking changes.** Skill names, on-disk layout, agent configuration, analyzer rule IDs, and CLI tool surfaces are all subject to change without notice. There is no SemVer commitment until v1.0. If you need a stable pin, install from a release tag instead of the rolling marketplace (see [Pinning to a release](#pinning-to-a-release)). Outputs are suggestions, not authoritative answers — review them before committing or shipping anything they produce.

## Install

The plugin requires **GitHub Copilot** (`winget install GitHub.Copilot`), **Claude Code**, or **OpenAI Codex** installed. 

**Git** (`winget install Git.Git`) is required for installing pluggins.

### Option A — Just ask Copilot to do it

Paste this prompt into a Copilot CLI session. It installs the plugin **and** sets up every prerequisite in one shot:

```
Install the Copilot CLI plugin "winui" from microsoft/win-dev-skills, then set up my machine for WinUI 3 development. Specifically:

1. Run: copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/win-dev-skills
2. Run: copilot plugin install winui@win-dev-skills
3. Make sure these prerequisites are present (check first and change only what is missing or too old):
   - .NET SDK >= 8.0.100 (run `dotnet --list-sdks`; if none qualifies, `winget install --id Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10 --exact --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`)
   - WinApp CLI: must be >= 0.6.0 (parse the standalone version line from `winapp --version`); if missing, `winget install --id Microsoft.WinAppCli`; if older, `winget upgrade --id Microsoft.WinAppCli`.
   - Do not install WinUI templates separately — WinApp CLI 0.6+ installs and updates them on demand through `winapp new`.
   - Developer Mode (DWORD HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock\AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense == 1) — ASK ME first before triggering UAC; if I decline, just print the elevated command for me to run later.
4. Print a short summary of what was installed vs already present, then tell me to start a new Copilot CLI, activate the "winui-dev" agent, and to ask it to build an app.
```

### Option B — Install the plugin yourself, then ask the agent to set up the rest

If you'd rather run the plugin commands by hand:

<details>
<summary><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong></summary>

The plugin is listed on **awesome-copilot** and can be installed directly:

```powershell
copilot plugin install winui@awesome-copilot
```

Or add this repo as a marketplace and install from there:

```powershell
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/win-dev-skills
copilot plugin install winui@win-dev-skills
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```powershell
claude plugin marketplace add microsoft/win-dev-skills
claude plugin install winui@win-dev-skills
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenAI Codex</strong></summary>

Add the `microsoft/win-dev-skills` marketplace, then enable the `winui` plugin from the plugin directory.

> **Note:** Codex doesn't have an "agents" concept, so the orchestrator agent isn't exposed there. The skills still work - invoke them by name (e.g. `/winui-setup`, `/winui-design`) and Codex will load them on demand.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenClaw</strong></summary>

Install straight from this repo - no marketplace pre-registration needed. The explicit `--marketplace` source clones the repo on demand, reads its marketplace manifest, and installs the `winui` plugin natively (`Format: openclaw`):

```powershell
openclaw plugins install winui --marketplace microsoft/win-dev-skills
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or from a local clone:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills
openclaw plugins install ./win-dev-skills/plugins/winui
```

Verify the eight skills loaded with `openclaw skills list` (each shows `✓ ready`).

> **Note:** OpenClaw maps skills, not agents, so the `winui-dev` orchestrator agent isn't exposed there. The skills still work - ask the agent for a WinUI task and it loads the relevant skill on demand.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenCode</strong></summary>

OpenCode loads Agent Skills natively from `<name>/SKILL.md` folders. Point it at the
shared skills - no fork or copy needed. Link each skill into OpenCode's global skills
directory (or a project's `.opencode/skills/`):

```powershell
# One-time setup: link the shared skills into OpenCode's global skills directory
$src = "C:\path\to\win-dev-skills\plugins\winui\agent-plugin\skills"
$dst = "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\skills"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $dst | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem $src -Directory | ForEach-Object {
  $link = Join-Path $dst $_.Name
  if (-not (Test-Path $link)) {
    New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path $link -Target $_.FullName | Out-Null
  }
}
```

Because these are junctions (not copies), `git pull` in the repo picks up upstream
skill updates automatically.

> **Note:** OpenCode maps skills, not agents, so the `winui-dev` orchestrator agent
> isn't exposed there. The skills still work - invoke them by name (e.g. `/winui-setup`,
> `/winui-design`) and OpenCode loads them on demand.
</details>

Then start a new session and run the `winui-setup` skill with `/winui-setup`.

Once setup is done, try a real task:

> "Build me a WinUI 3 markdown editor with live preview and a custom title bar"

### What gets installed

| Tool | Minimum | Recommended | Install command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Git | 2.54 | 2.54+ | `winget install Git.Git` |
| .NET SDK | 8.0.100 | 10.0 | `winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10` |
| WinApp CLI | 0.6.0 | latest | `winget install Microsoft.WinAppCli` |
| Developer Mode | enabled | enabled | DWORD `AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense` set to `1` |

Visual Studio is **not required** — these skills build and run entirely with dotnet. Neither setup path will install it; if you want it as an IDE, run:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Universal"
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Older Windows App SDK versions had a XAML-compiler bug** under `dotnet build`: a malformed `.xaml` file produced no useful diagnostic — the build just failed with a cryptic `MSB3073` (`XamlCompiler.exe ... exited with code 1`) and no indication of which `.xaml` was wrong. This is **fixed in current releases** — Windows App SDK **≥ 2.1.3** on the 2.x line and **≥ 1.8** on the 1.x line. If you hit a cryptic build failure with no XAML diagnostic, **update the `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` NuGet package to the latest version**. WinApp CLI 0.6+ builds the project directly through `winapp run <project>`.

## Why a Copilot CLI plugin?

Modern Windows app development covers a lot of ground — XAML and Fluent Design, MVVM, MSIX packaging, code signing, Store submission, accessibility, theming, UI automation. AI agents working from generic web context tend to mix WinUI 3 with older stacks (UWP, WPF), miss the packaged-execution model, or stop short of running and verifying what they built. These skills **stay in the WinUI 3 lane end-to-end** — from `winapp new` through a signed MSIX — and pair the agent with tools that give it real, ground-truth answers instead of guesses.

The result: you ask `copilot -p "create a WinUI 3 photo viewer with thumbnails and EXIF metadata"`, and the agent picks the right template, scaffolds the project, designs the XAML with theming and accessibility in mind, wires up MVVM correctly, builds, fixes errors with real diagnostics, launches through the right packaged-execution pipeline, and (if you ask) drives the running app through UI automation to validate it works.

### The agent: `winui-dev`

A focused agent for WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK / XAML / C# work. Use it for new apps, adding features, converting from WPF/Electron/web, or fixing bugs. It pulls in the skills below as needed.

### The eight skills

Each skill is a focused, self-contained playbook. The agent loads `winui-design` and `winui-dev-workflow` by default — those cover most "build me a WinUI 3 app" requests end-to-end. You opt into the others when you want them, including `winui-setup` for one-time machine prep.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`winui-dev-workflow`** | Build and run workflow — `winapp new`, project-mode `winapp run`, the analyzer-injecting `BuildAndRun.ps1` helper, crash diagnosis, and prerequisites. |
| **`winui-design`** | UI design and XAML correctness — layout planning, control selection, Fluent Design, theming (Light/Dark/HighContrast), typography, spacing, brushes, accessibility, data-binding review, and grounded sample lookup with `winapp find-ui`. |
| **`winui-code-review`** | Code-quality review before committing — MVVM compliance, `x:Bind` correctness, accessibility, theming, security, performance. Catches what the compiler and UI tests won't. |
| **`winui-ui-testing`** | Automated UI testing — generates a batch test script, runs all tests in one pass, reads results. Covers element assertions, interactions, value checks (TextBox, ComboBox, ToggleSwitch), file pickers, flyouts, dialogs, persistence, accessibility audits. |
| **`winui-packaging`** | MSIX packaging, code signing, and distribution — release builds, certificate generation (`winapp cert generate`), trust, signing (`winapp sign`), self-contained deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and Microsoft Store submission. |
| **`winui-wpf-migration`** | WPF → WinUI 3 migration — namespace replacement, control mapping (`DataGrid` → `ListView`, `WrapPanel` → `ItemsRepeater`, `TabControl` → `TabView`), `Dispatcher` → `DispatcherQueue`, `System.Drawing` → `BitmapImage`, MVVM conversion to CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, `DynamicResource` → `ThemeResource`. |
| **`winui-session-report`** | Diagnostic report on the current or a recent Copilot session. Runs only after an explicit request for session feedback, agent debugging, or a review of what happened during a build session. |
| **`winui-setup`** | Install and verify machine prerequisites — .NET SDK 8.0.100+, WinApp CLI 0.6+, and Developer Mode. Templates are managed on demand by `winapp new`. Idempotent and **explicit confirmation required**. |

## The tools we lean on

Skills are *prompts plus playbooks*. They get their actual leverage from a small set of tools — some external, some included in this repo.

### External tools the skills depend on

* **[`winapp` CLI 0.6+](https://github.com/microsoft/winappcli)** (install with `/winui-setup`) — the command-line driver for scaffolding, discovering UI samples, building, running, signing, packaging, and **automating** WinUI 3 / WinAppSDK apps. `winapp new` manages the official WinUI template pack and creates projects; `winapp find-ui` returns grounded Gallery/Toolkit/core samples; project-mode `winapp run` builds a `.csproj` and launches packaged or unpackaged output; `winapp ui` powers the UI-testing skill; and `winapp manifest`/`winapp package` carry builds through signed MSIX creation.

### In-repo tools — what's running on your machine

Several skills ship helper binaries and PowerShell scripts that run under your user account. **None of them are code-signed today.** They live in this repo so you can read the source, build them yourself, and verify what they do — that's an explicit launch-preview trade-off, not a long-term distribution model.

| Artifact | Source | What it does | Long-term plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Analyzers.dll`** (Roslyn analyzer) | [`src/tools/winui-analyzer/`](src/tools/winui-analyzer/) | Catches common WinUI 3 / WinAppSDK pitfalls at build time: UWP namespace leaks, `Window.Current`, `CoreDispatcher`, `WebView2` without `EnsureCoreWebView2Async`, raw `TabView` content, attached-property syntax bugs, removed ONNX GenAI APIs, the old field-backed `[ObservableProperty]` pattern, and more. Every rule ships at `Warning` severity (no `Error`s) and includes a `helpLinkUri`. Verified against source on every PR by the `analyzer-provenance` CI job. | Publish as the `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Analyzers` NuGet package; skill stops shipping the prebuilt DLL and projects pick it up via `<PackageReference>`. |
| **`winmd.exe`** (winmd-cli) | [`src/tools/winmd-cli/`](src/tools/winmd-cli/) | Native-AOT WinRT/.NET metadata indexer. The agent uses it to verify an API actually exists and has the signature it thinks it does — *before* writing code that won't compile. Reads `.winmd` and managed `.dll` metadata from NuGet, the Windows SDK, and WinAppSDK and returns the same XML doc text Visual Studio IntelliSense uses. | Publish as a `dotnet tool` on NuGet, or fold relevant subcommands into [`winappcli`](https://github.com/microsoft/winappcli). |
| **`BuildAndRun.ps1`** | [`plugins/winui/agent-plugin/skills/winui-dev-workflow/BuildAndRun.ps1`](plugins/winui/agent-plugin/skills/winui-dev-workflow/BuildAndRun.ps1) | Thin wrapper over project-mode `winapp run`: injects the bundled WinAppSDK analyzer through a temporary MSBuild props file and enables crash diagnostics by default. WinApp CLI owns restore, build, architecture/output discovery, runtime setup, registration, and launch. | Remove when the analyzer is published as a NuGet package and projects can reference it directly. |
| **`Analyze-Session.ps1`** | [`plugins/winui/agent-plugin/skills/winui-session-report/Analyze-Session.ps1`](plugins/winui/agent-plugin/skills/winui-session-report/Analyze-Session.ps1) | Reads your local Copilot session events and produces a `session-report.md` for bug filing. **The report can include excerpts of your prompts, file paths, and command output — review it before sharing.** The skill prints a privacy notice when it runs. | Fold into the `copilot` CLI as a session-report subcommand, or publish as a `dotnet tool`. |

If any of this is a deal-breaker for your environment, please [open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills/issues) — that feedback is what determines how quickly each item moves out of "preview, ships from repo" into "signed package on a registry".

### Building the in-repo tools yourself

```powershell
# Build both C# tools, run the analyzer test suite, AOT-publish winmd-cli,
# and refresh the committed analyzer payload. This is the same build the
# pr-validation workflow runs in CI.
./scripts/build-tools.ps1
```

Per-tool READMEs cover what they do and how to consume them in more detail:

* [`src/tools/winui-analyzer/README.md`](src/tools/winui-analyzer/README.md) — analyzer + rule catalog
* [`src/tools/winmd-cli/README.md`](src/tools/winmd-cli/README.md) — `winmd` CLI usage

## Pinning to a release

The default install (`copilot plugin install winui@win-dev-skills`) tracks
`main` HEAD — every promotion to `main` is a tagged release, but the
marketplace install path always picks up the latest. If you need a stable
pin, install from the git URL with a tag ref instead:

```powershell
copilot plugin install https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills.git#v0.3.0
```

```powershell
claude plugin install https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills.git#v0.3.0
```

Browse available tags at <https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills/tags>.

## How releases work

Day-to-day work lands on a `staging` branch via PRs. Periodically a maintainer
opens a **promotion PR** (`staging → main`) that bumps the version and
updates `CHANGELOG.md`; merging that PR auto-creates a `vX.Y.Z` git tag at
the merge commit. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
contributor flow and [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) for the maintainer
playbook.

## Portable packaging across agents

The plugin follows the vendor-neutral [Agent Plugins 1.0 specification](https://agent-plugins.org/specification). Compatible clients discover the shared skills from the fixed `skills/` directory, and CI validates each one with the [Agent Skills reference validator](https://agentskills.io/specification#validation). Capabilities that are not part of the portable v1 core remain in client-specific locations.

Agent Plugins 1.0 standardizes [skills and MCP server packaging](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec/blob/main/spec/1.0.0.md#7-component-types), but it does not standardize custom agents. The `winui-dev` agent therefore lives under GitHub Copilot's [`com.github.copilot/` extension namespace](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-08-12-agent-plugins-1-0-in-vs-code-copilot-cli-and-the-copilot-app/) and is mirrored in the outer compatibility package's `agents/` directory for Claude Code. CI requires both copies to remain content-identical.

The separate package roots are intentional. The Agent Plugins specification requires [client-specific files to use reverse-domain top-level namespaces](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec/blob/main/spec/1.0.0.md#8-client-extensions), while Claude Code and OpenAI Codex still require `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` at the root of the package they install, and OpenClaw requires its own root manifest and JavaScript entry point. GitHub Copilot and other conforming clients therefore install `plugins/winui/agent-plugin`; the Claude, Codex, and OpenClaw integrations install the containing `plugins/winui` compatibility package and reference the canonical `agent-plugin/skills/` directory. This follows the specification's [additive migration guidance](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-example/blob/main/skills/migrate-agent-plugin/references/migration-guide.md#6-preserve-platform-behavior) without duplicating the eight skills or their binary payloads.

Marketplace artwork is available as [`assets/logo.svg`](plugins/winui/agent-plugin/assets/logo.svg) and [`assets/logo-512.png`](plugins/winui/agent-plugin/assets/logo-512.png). Codex references these files from its client-specific manifest; other marketplace publishing flows can upload them directly. They are intentionally not declared in the portable manifest because `logo` is not part of the [Agent Plugins 1.0 manifest schema](https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json).

## Help us improve

After trying the skills, run the `winui-session-report` skill. It analyzes your session — turns, tokens, build patterns, what worked, what didn't — and produces a `session-report.md` file. **The file may contain excerpts of your prompts, file paths, and command output, so review it before sharing.** Please attach it when you [open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/win-dev-skills/issues) — the bug template asks for it.

If a skill produces something wrong, surprising, or just not as good as it should be, we want to know. Skill names, scopes, structure, distribution mechanics for the analyzer and CLI tools, the `BuildAndRun.ps1` workaround — **everything you see today is a starting point**, and feedback in the next few months shapes where each piece lands.

When you open a PR, the `pr-validation` workflow rebuilds the analyzer DLL, runs the analyzer test suite, validates the plugin manifest and skill frontmatter, and verifies the committed analyzer binary matches its source. The `release-policy` workflow additionally enforces the staging/main split (no version bumps in feature PRs; required version bump + CHANGELOG entry in promotion PRs). Run [`scripts/build-tools.ps1`](scripts/build-tools.ps1) locally before pushing to keep those checks green.
