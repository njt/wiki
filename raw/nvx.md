# NVX: An Ultra-Light Micro-VM Sandbox

NVX is an ultra-light micro-VM sandbox for running untrusted workloads with hardware-enforced
isolation. It is built on top of OpenVMM and runs Linux as a guest.

NVX was jointly developed by the [MSR Systems Research Group][msr-systems] and
[Azure Research - Systems][azure-systems], building on research results from the
[Nanvix](https://github.com/nanvix) system.

[msr-systems]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-redmond/
[azure-systems]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-research-systems/

This repository includes version pins for Linux and OpenVMM, along with the patches, guest source
files, build tools, and benchmarks needed to use NVX.

## Quick Start

Python 3.10 or newer is required. The commands below download the prebuilt NVX package for the
selected platform from the cloned revision's release when available, or from its nearest released
first-parent ancestor otherwise, so no local build is required. A successful boot prints
`NVX-GUEST-BOOT-OK: alpine` and opens a root shell. Select Ubuntu userland with the same NVX kernel
by passing `--guest ubuntu`.

Exit cleanly from the guest with `/sbin/nvx-exit 0`. See the [setup](doc/setup.md) and
[run](doc/run.md) guides for detailed prerequisites and runtime options.

> ℹ️ For direct OpenVMM integration without the `scripts/nvx.py` runtime harness,
see [Run OpenVMM directly](doc/run.md#run-openvmm-directly).

### Linux / KVM

Requires [KVM configured with read/write access to `/dev/kvm`](doc/setup.md#linux--kvm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/nvx.git && cd nvx
python3 scripts/nvx.py download
python3 scripts/nvx.py run
```

### Linux / MSHV

Requires [MSHV configured with read/write access to `/dev/mshv`](doc/setup.md#linux--mshv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/nvx.git && cd nvx
python3 scripts/nvx.py download --hypervisor mshv
python3 scripts/nvx.py run --hypervisor mshv
```

### Windows / WHP

Requires [Windows Hypervisor Platform enabled](doc/setup.md#windows--whp).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/nvx.git; Set-Location nvx
python scripts\nvx.py download
python scripts\nvx.py run
```
