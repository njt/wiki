An 8-stage vulnerability-discovery agent, driven by your **Claude Pro / Max
subscription** through the official Claude Code Agent SDK. Many narrow agents,
deliberate disagreement, and an explicit reachability gate.

MIT-licensed. No API key needed if you already use `claude login`.

This project is a from-scratch reimplementation of the pipeline described in
Cloudflare's Project Glasswing
post, which tested Anthropic's Mythos preview LLM against Cloudflare's own
codebase. The blog argues that real-world vulnerability discovery does **not**
come from asking one big model "find bugs here" — it comes from:

- **Many narrow agents**working in parallel on tightly-scoped questions ("Look for command injection in this specific function, with this trust boundary above it") rather than one exhaustive agent.
- **Deliberate disagreement**— a second agent, on a different model, that tries to- *disprove*the first agent's findings.
- **A reachability trace**as the gating step — most "is this code buggy?" findings are noise unless an attacker-controlled input can actually reach the sink from outside the system.
- **A feedback loop**so reachable bugs in one place automatically seed hunts for the same pattern elsewhere.

This repo packages that pipeline into a runnable agent. The Cloudflare post showed the architecture; this codebase ships the prompts, schemas, state store, and orchestrator.

Diagram from Cloudflare's Project Glasswing post, reproduced here for reference.

| # | Stage | Default model | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Recon | Opus 4.7 | Map the repo, emit narrowly-scoped Hunt tasks | 
| 2 | Hunt | Sonnet 4.6 | One attack class per agent; compile/run PoCs | 
| 3 | Validate | Opus 4.7 | Adversarial re-read; tries to disprove(different model from Hunt) | 
| 4 | Gapfill | Sonnet 4.6 | Re-queue under-covered areas | 
| 5 | Dedupe | Sonnet 4.6 | Cluster findings by root cause | 
| 6 | Trace | Opus 4.7 | Prove attacker-controlled input reaches the sink | 
| 7 | Feedback | Sonnet 4.6 | Turn reachable traces into new Hunt tasks | 
| 8 | Report | Sonnet 4.6 | Schema-validated structured report | 

Each stage is one markdown prompt in `prompts/` + one JSON Schema in
`schemas/`. The orchestrator passes the schema into the system prompt so
every output is shape-stable on the first try.

```
# 1. Install
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
# 2. Auth (pick one)
#    (a) Already logged in via claude login? You're done.
#    (b) Or generate a 1-year OAuth token for CI / non-interactive use:
claude setup-token
echo "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<paste>" > .env
# 3. Verify
audit auth-check
# 4. Run
audit run --repo /path/to/target --run-id my-run
audit status --run-id my-run
audit report --run-id my-run --format md > report.md
```
By default the agent uses **subscription billing** via your Claude.ai
login — it does **not** call the metered Anthropic API. The on-disk auth
module scrubs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment so it can't
silently route around the OAuth flow.

The auth module picks one of three modes, in this order:

- **LLM gateway**(OpenRouter, custom proxy, etc.) — when- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`points away from- `anthropic.com`AND- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`is set. The gateway env is left intact; only- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`is scrubbed (it would otherwise outrank the gateway token).
- **Subscription OAuth (headless)**—- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`from- `claude setup-token`. Best for CI.
- **Subscription OAuth (interactive)**—- `~/.claude/.credentials.json`from- `claude login`. Best for local dev.

OpenRouter exposes Claude-compatible Anthropic-API endpoints behind its
own credit system; that lets you spend OpenRouter credits instead of an
Anthropic subscription, and gives you access to Sonnet/Opus *and* other
models through the same SDK path. See OpenRouter's Agent SDK guide.

```
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""           # must be explicitly empty / unset
# optional: pick a non-Anthropic model
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
# or e.g.: ANTHROPIC_MODEL="openai/gpt-5"
#         ANTHROPIC_MODEL="google/gemini-2.5-pro"
#         ANTHROPIC_MODEL="qwen/qwen3-coder-480b"
audit auth-check                       # confirms "using LLM gateway at https://openrouter.ai/api"
audit run --repo /path/to/target --run-id orun --max-cost-usd 30
```
Caveats:

- Per-stage model overrides in `config/stages.yaml`are model**names**(e.g.`claude-opus-4-7`); OpenRouter accepts slash-prefixed forms like`anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`. Edit the YAML if you want different providers per stage. Otherwise`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`forces every stage onto one model.
- Non-Claude models may not produce schema-compliant JSON as reliably. The runner's schema-validation + repair turn still applies; quality varies by model.
- Tool-use semantics (Read/Grep/Glob/Bash) are part of the Claude Code CLI, not the model — they work as long as the gateway speaks the Anthropic Messages API.

Same recipe — anything that exposes the Anthropic Messages API at a URL

- a bearer token works:

```
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://your-proxy.example.com"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$YOUR_TOKEN"
unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```
For Amazon Bedrock / Google Vertex / Microsoft Foundry, Claude Code has
first-class env-var flags (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` etc.) that
outrank everything else. See the Claude Code auth docs.

A real production codebase can produce 15-50 Hunt tasks and 25+ findings to validate. At default concurrency this gets expensive. Flags to keep it sane:

```
audit run --repo /path/to/target \
  --max-concurrency 1 \           # one claude subprocess at a time
  --max-recon-tasks 15 \          # cap initial Hunt fanout
  --max-cost-usd 30               # abort cleanly if exceeded
```
The budget guard fires between *and* within stages — a per-task check in
Hunt cooperatively aborts rather than running 30 more tasks past the cap.

If the target has a running deployment, point the agents at it. Hunt now
**reproduces** each finding against the live service instead of compiling
a local PoC, Validate **rejects** findings that don't reproduce, and Trace
**confirms** reachability with real HTTP round-trips. The static path
remains available — these flags are opt-in.

```
audit run --repo /path/to/target --run-id live \
  --max-concurrency 1 --max-cost-usd 30 \
  --target-url http://server.local:8888 \
  --target-creds email=admin@system.com \
  --target-creds password=changechangeme
```
Rules the agents follow when `--target-url` is set:

- Network egress is restricted to that host + `127.0.0.1`. No other external hosts.
- A finding that doesn't reproduce against the live target is dropped or rejected (depending on stage) — "no fabrication".
- Credentials flow into every relevant stage's user_input as a dict.

Targets often have intentionally-loose-by-design surfaces that aren't bugs (e.g. plaintext API keys when that's a feature, test-only Mailpit endpoints, anonymous-analytics ingest). Drop them in a text file and pass it in — the notes are appended verbatim to every stage's user_input, and Recon / Hunt / Validate honor exclusions you list.

`audit run --repo /path/to/target --scope-notes target_scope.md`Example `target_scope.md`:

```
- Mailpit (port 1025) is test-only; ignore.
- Plaintext API keys in the database are a required feature.
- Don't flag rate-limit absence on anonymous /ping endpoints.
- Only consider critical/high severity.
```
Recon greps the git history for past security patches
(`CVE`, `sec:`, `fix.*auth`, `sanitize`, …) — patched files are hardened,
but **sibling files with the same idiom often aren't**. Findings get seeded
against the unpatched copies. Adds zero cost on repos without that pattern;
catches real cross-component bugs on repos that have it.

The pipeline's default is one-attack-class-per-task (the Cloudflare paper's
narrow-scope rule). Recon can also emit `logic_chain` tasks for high-impact
multi-component paths (auth-bypass + IDOR + path-traversal that compose into
RCE, etc.) — one chain per task, with the `scope_hint` naming the specific
chain. This is the one allowed exception to single-attack-class scoping.

```
prompts/        8 stage prompts (markdown, loaded as system prompts)
schemas/        9 JSON schemas — every agent output is validated
config/         stages.yaml — model + concurrency + tool allowlist per stage
audit/          Python package
  auth.py       OAuth check + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY scrubbing
  state.py      SQLite DAO (runs, tasks, findings, traces, dedupe, costs)
  runner.py     claude-agent-sdk wrapper with schema validation + repair turn
  orchestrator.py pipeline driver
  stages/       one module per stage
work/           per-Hunt-task scratch dirs (sandbox for PoC compile/run)
results/        JSONL artifacts per stage + final report.json
state.db        SQLite (gitignored)
```
Hunt agents have Bash and run inside per-task scratch dirs. They are **not**
sandboxed at the OS level. Run the audit inside a disposable VM or container
when you don't trust the target source — a target with malicious build
scripts could otherwise execute on your host during PoC compilation.

The agent reads everything you `--add-dir`, including any `.env` or
`secrets/` directories in the target. Outputs land in `results/<run-id>/`
which is `.gitignore`d but **not** scrubbed of those reads.
