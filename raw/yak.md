  <strong>Yak is an autonomous coding agent for papercuts, a line-by-line PR reviewer, and a per-branch preview server. One shared sandbox fleet powers all three workflows.</strong>

## What It Does

- **Opens PRs for papercuts.** Receives tasks from Slack, Linear, Sentry, and GitHub; sends Claude into an isolated sandbox; opens a reviewable PR and verifies CI passes
- **Reviews pull requests.** Line-level comments, `suggestion` blocks, and a feedback dashboard
- **Serves preview deployments.** Every open PR gets a unique URL, OAuth-gated, hibernated when idle, destroyed when the PR closes
- **Shared sandbox fleet.** One Incus + ZFS substrate, one GitHub App, one Inertia dashboard, one cost model across all three workflows

## How It Works

</p>

## Quick Start

See the [Setup Guide](https://geocodio.github.io/yak/setup/) for provisioning a fresh server with Ansible, or the [Development Guide](https://geocodio.github.io/yak/development/) for running Yak locally.

## Channel Support

| Channel  | Input (receive tasks) | Notifications (send updates) |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Slack    | Yes                   | Yes                          |
| Linear   | Yes                   | Yes                          |
| Sentry   | Yes                   | --                           |
| GitHub   | Yes (PR review events)| Yes (PR reviews, comments)   |

## Design Philosophy

- **Laravel-native** -- built on Laravel 13, Inertia 3, and React on `@geocodio/console-ui`.
- **Channel-agnostic** -- driver-based architecture makes it easy to add new input and notification channels.
- **State machine driven** -- every task follows a defined lifecycle with explicit transitions.
- **AI-assisted, human-supervised** -- tasks are automated but observable through the dashboard and notifications.
