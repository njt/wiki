**A parallel AI window that shares your context. Talk to any model while your main session keeps working.**

Sidecar opens a real UI alongside Claude Code or Cowork, pre-loaded with your conversation context, connected to Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok, or any other model. You interact with the sidecar in parallel (fact-check Claude's work, get a second opinion, explore a tangent) then fold the results back when you're ready.


Supported clients:Claude Code CLI and Claude Cowork are fully tested and supported. Claude Code web and Claude Desktop are experimental.

Sidecar is a **literal second window** that runs alongside your Claude Code or Cowork session. It:

- **Shares your context.**Your current conversation history is automatically extracted and passed to the sidecar. No copy-pasting, no re-explaining.
- **Runs in parallel.**Your main Claude session keeps working while you interact with the sidecar. It's not sequential, it's simultaneous.
- **Connects to any model.**Gemini 3.1 Pro (1M context), GPT-5.4, DeepSeek v3.2, Qwen, Grok: whatever's best for the job.
- **Folds back cleanly.**When you're done, click FOLD and a structured summary returns to your main context. No noise, just results.

Claude just proposed an architecture or made a claim? Open a sidecar to a different model and verify it, with full context already loaded.

Designing something complex? Fork the conversation to Gemini or GPT-5.4 for an independent take. Compare approaches before committing to one.

Need to explore a rabbit hole (trace a bug, read a huge file, research an API)? Do it in the sidecar. Your main session stays clean and focused.

While Claude implements a fix, spin up a sidecar to review the test coverage, audit security implications, or draft documentation, all at the same time.

- **Gemini 3.1 Pro**: 1M token context for analyzing entire codebases
- **GPT-5.4**: Strong at code generation and refactoring
- **DeepSeek v3.2**: Cost-effective reasoning at scale
- **Qwen 3.5**: High-quality open-weight reasoning
- **Grok**: Fast iteration and broad knowledge

- Node.js 18+

`npm install -g claude-sidecar`On install, sidecar automatically configures itself for all supported clients:

- **Claude Code CLI**: Registers an MCP server and installs a Skill, so Claude can launch and manage sidecars on your behalf
- **Claude Desktop & Cowork**: Registers an MCP server, so sidecar tools appear natively in the UI

No manual registration needed. Just install and run setup.

`sidecar setup`This launches a **graphical setup wizard** that walks you through everything:

| Step | What It Does | 
|---|---|
| 1. API Keys | Enter keys for OpenRouter, Google, OpenAI, and/or Anthropic. Each key is validated live against the provider's API. Keys are stored locally at `~/.config/sidecar/.env`with restricted permissions (0600). | 
| 2. Default Model | Choose your go-to model from 20+ aliases (Gemini, GPT, Opus, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok, and more). This is what sidecar uses when you omit `--model`. | 
| 3. Model Routing | Configure which provider serves each model. If you have both an OpenRouter key and a direct Google key, you can route Gemini through Google directly and everything else through OpenRouter. | 
| 4. Review | Summary of your configuration before saving. | 


Headless environments:If Electron isn't available, the wizard falls back to a readline-based setup in the terminal.

You can also manage individual settings without re-running the full wizard:

`sidecar setup --add-alias fast=openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview``sidecar start --model gemini --prompt "Hello, confirm sidecar is working"`A window should open alongside your editor with Gemini ready to chat, pre-loaded with your Claude Code context.

```
# Fact-check: open a sidecar to verify Claude's approach
sidecar start --model gemini --prompt "Fact-check the auth approach Claude just proposed"
# Second opinion: get a different model's take
sidecar start --model gpt --prompt "Review this feature design. Is there a simpler approach?"
# Deep dive: investigate without polluting your main context
sidecar start --model gemini-pro --prompt "Analyze the entire codebase architecture"
# Headless: autonomous, no UI, summary returns automatically
sidecar start --model gemini --prompt "Generate Jest tests for src/utils/" --no-ui
# Use your configured default model (just omit --model)
sidecar start --prompt "Security review the payment module"
```
- **Context sharing.**Sidecar reads your Claude Code session from- `~/.claude/projects/[project]/[session].jsonl`and passes it to the sidecar model automatically.
- **Window launch.**An Electron window opens alongside your editor with the sidecar UI (OpenCode-powered).
- **Parallel interaction.**You converse with the sidecar model while your main Claude session continues working independently.
- **Fold.**Click FOLD (or press- `Cmd+Shift+F`) to generate a structured summary.
- **Context return.**The summary flows back into your Claude Code context for Claude to act on.

The Electron shell uses a **BrowserView** architecture: the OpenCode web UI loads in a dedicated viewport, while the sidecar toolbar (branding, timer, Fold button) renders in the bottom 40px. No CSS conflicts with the host app.

**Interactive (default):** Opens a window alongside Claude Code. You converse with the sidecar, steer the investigation, then click **FOLD** to generate a structured summary. Switch models mid-conversation without restarting.

**Headless ( --no-ui):** The agent works autonomously in the background. When done, outputs a 

`[SIDECAR_FOLD]` summary automatically. Ideal for bulk tasks: test generation, documentation, linting.Your conversation history is automatically shared with the sidecar. No re-explaining needed. Filter by turns (`--context-turns`) or time window (`--context-since 2h`).

Sidecar detects its launch context and adapts:

- **From Claude Code**(- `--client code-local`): Engineering-focused (debug, implement, review)
- **From Cowork**(- `--client cowork`): General-purpose (research, analyze, write, brainstorm)

Sidecar automatically discovers MCP servers configured in your Claude Code session (`~/.claude.json`) and passes them through to the sidecar's OpenCode instance. Your sidecar has access to the same tools you do. Control this with:

- `--no-mcp`disables MCP inheritance entirely
- `--exclude-mcp <name>`excludes specific servers (repeatable)
- `--mcp name=url`adds additional servers

- **Conflict detection**: Warns when files changed externally while the sidecar was running
- **Drift awareness**: Indicates when the sidecar's context may be stale relative to your current session
- **Pre-flight validation**: All CLI inputs are validated before anything launches

Sidecar checks the npm registry for updates once every 24 hours (cached, zero-latency background check). When an update is available:

- **CLI:**A notification box appears in your terminal after any command
- **Electron UI:**A banner appears above the toolbar with a one-click- **Update**button. No terminal commands needed.

Updating installs the latest code **and** re-runs the postinstall step, so your Claude Code Skill file and MCP registrations are always kept in sync with the latest version. No manual re-registration needed.

```
# Or update manually from the CLI
sidecar update
```
Every sidecar is persisted. List past sessions, read their summaries, reopen them, or chain them together.

```
sidecar list                           # See all past sidecars
sidecar read abc123                    # Read the summary
sidecar resume abc123                  # Reopen the exact session
sidecar continue abc123 --prompt "..." # New session building on previous findings
```
Full MCP server for Claude Desktop and Cowork. Sidecar tools appear natively inside Cowork's sandboxed environment. No CLI required.

```
`sidecar resume <task_id>`Reopens the exact OpenCode session with full conversation history preserved.

`sidecar continue <task_id> --prompt "Now implement the fix from the analysis"`Starts a **new** session with the previous session's conversation as read-only background context. Optionally switch models.

```
sidecar read <task_id>                  # Summary (default)
sidecar read <task_id> --conversation   # Full conversation
sidecar read <task_id> --metadata       # Session metadata
```
`sidecar abort <task_id>`Immediately stops a running sidecar session. The session status changes to `aborted`.

```
sidecar setup                                           # Full setup wizard (GUI)
sidecar setup --add-alias fast=openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
```
Opens the graphical setup wizard for API keys, default model, model routing, and aliases. See Getting Started for details.

`sidecar update`Updates sidecar to the latest npm release. In the Electron UI, click the **Update** button in the banner instead. No terminal needed.

Three primary modes control what the sidecar can do autonomously:

| Agent | Reads | Writes/Bash | Best For | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat(default) | Auto-approved | Asks permission | Questions, analysis, fact-checking, guided exploration | 
| Plan | Auto-approved | Blocked entirely | Code review, architecture analysis, security audits | 
| Build | Auto-approved | Auto-approved | Implementation tasks, test generation, headless batch work | 

```
# Chat: good for fact-checking and analysis with human-in-the-loop (default)
sidecar start --model gemini --prompt "Verify Claude's approach to the auth refactor"
# Plan: strict read-only, no changes possible
sidecar start --model gemini --agent Plan --prompt "Security review of the payment module"
# Build: full autonomy, use when you explicitly want it to write code
sidecar start --model gemini --agent Build --no-ui \
  --prompt "Generate comprehensive Jest tests for src/utils/"
```

Headless mode note:`--no-ui`defaults to`Build`. The`Chat`agent requires interactive UI for write permissions and stalls in headless mode.

| Direct Google | `google/model` | `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` | 
| Direct OpenAI | `openai/model` | `openai/gpt-5.4` | 
| Direct Anthropic | `anthropic/model` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` | 

The prefix determines which credentials are used. Model names evolve; verify current names:

`curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models | jq '.data[].id' | grep -i gemini`For Claude Desktop and Cowork, sidecar exposes a full MCP server auto-registered on install.

To register manually:

`claude mcp add-json sidecar '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","claude-sidecar@latest","mcp"]}' --scope user`| MCP Tool | Description | 
|---|---|
| `sidecar_start` | Spawn a sidecar (returns task ID immediately) | 
| `sidecar_status` | Poll for completion | 
| `sidecar_read` | Get results: summary, conversation, or metadata | 
| `sidecar_list` | List past sessions | 
| `sidecar_resume` | Reopen a session | 
| `sidecar_continue` | New session building on previous | 
| `sidecar_abort` | Stop a running session | 
| `sidecar_setup` | Open setup wizard | 
| `sidecar_guide` | Get usage instructions | 

**Async pattern:** `sidecar_start` returns a task ID immediately. Poll with `sidecar_status`, then read results with `sidecar_read`. This is non-blocking: the calling agent can do other work while the sidecar runs.

| Variable | Description | Default | 
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for OpenRouter (multi-model access) | (required) | 
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Direct Google API key (bypasses OpenRouter) | |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Direct OpenAI API key | |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct Anthropic API key | |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity: `error``warn``info``debug` | `error` | 
| `SIDECAR_CONFIG_DIR` | Override config directory | `~/.config/sidecar` | 
| `SIDECAR_ENV_DIR` | Override `.env`file directory | |
| `SIDECAR_TIMEOUT` | Default headless timeout in minutes | `15` | 
| `OPENCODE_COMMAND` | Override OpenCode binary path | `opencode` | 

API keys configured via `sidecar setup` are stored in `~/.config/sidecar/.env` with restricted permissions (0600). You can also set them as environment variables directly.

Every fold produces a structured summary:

```
## Sidecar Results: [Title]
**Context Age:** [How stale the context might be]
**FILE CONFLICT WARNING** [If files changed while the sidecar ran]
**Task:** What was requested
**Findings:** Key discoveries

```
| Issue | Cause | Solution | 
|---|---|---|
| `command not found: opencode` | OpenCode binary not found | Reinstall: `npm install -g claude-sidecar`(opencode-ai is bundled) | 
| 401 Unauthorized / auth errors | API key missing or wrong provider prefix | Run `sidecar setup`to configure keys, or verify`openrouter/...`prefix matches your credentials | 
| Headless stalls silently | `Chat`agent in headless mode | Use `--agent build`, not`--agent chat`in headless mode | 
| Session not found | No matching session ID | Run `sidecar list`, or omit`--session-id`to use most recent | 
| No conversation history found | Project path encoding | Check `ls ~/.claude/projects/`.`/`and`_`are encoded as`-`in path | 
| Headless timeout | Task too complex for default timeout | Increase with `--timeout 30` | 
| Summary corrupted | Debug output leaking to stdout | Use `LOG_LEVEL=debug`to diagnose | 
| Multiple active sessions | Ambiguous session resolution | Pass `--session-id`explicitly | 
| Setup wizard won't open | Electron not available | Falls back to terminal setup automatically; ensure `electron`is in dependencies |

Sidecar uses a novel approach for testing Electron UI features: instead of fragile DOM mock tests, we verify the real UI by connecting to the running Electron app via the **Chrome DevTools Protocol** (CDP).

**How it works:**

- Launch sidecar with `SIDECAR_DEBUG_PORT=9223`(avoids conflict with Chrome on 9222)
- Use `SIDECAR_MOCK_UPDATE=available`or other mock env vars to force specific UI states
- Connect to `http://127.0.0.1:9223/json`to discover debug targets
- Execute JavaScript in the Electron renderer via WebSocket to inspect DOM state
- Take a screenshot with `screencapture`to visually verify

```
# Launch with mock update banner and debug port
SIDECAR_MOCK_UPDATE=available SIDECAR_DEBUG_PORT=9223 \
  sidecar start --model gemini --prompt "test"
# Find the toolbar page
TOOLBAR_ID=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9223/json | \
  node -e "const d=require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8'); \
  const p=JSON.parse(d).find(p=>p.url?.startsWith('data:')); \
  console.log(p?.id||'NOT_FOUND')")
# Inspect toolbar state (update banner, buttons, timer)
node -e "
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:9223/devtools/page/$TOOLBAR_ID');
ws.on('open', () => ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  id: 1, method: 'Runtime.evaluate',
  params: { expression: '({banner: document.getElementById(\"update-banner\")?.style?.display, text: document.getElementById(\"update-text\")?.textContent})', returnByValue: true }
})));
ws.on('message', d => { const m=JSON.parse(d.toString()); if(m.id===1){console.log(JSON.stringify(m.result?.result?.value,null,2));ws.close();process.exit(0);} });
setTimeout(() => { ws.close(); process.exit(0); }, 3000);
"
```
This approach tests real rendering in a real Electron window, not mocked DOM behavior. See docs/electron-testing.md for the full reference.

Sidecar is a harness built on top of **OpenCode**, the open-source AI coding engine. OpenCode provides the conversation runtime, tool execution framework, agent system, and web UI. Sidecar adds context sharing from Claude Code, the Electron shell, fold/summary workflow, session persistence, and multi-client support (CLI, MCP, Cowork). We don't reinvent the wheel. OpenCode handles the hard parts of LLM interaction so Sidecar can focus on the parallel-window workflow.
