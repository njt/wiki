# rdc — Remote Desktop Control for AI agents

Let a coding agent on your laptop **see and operate another computer's desktop** over your
Tailscale network: take screenshots, move and click the mouse, type, press shortcuts, focus
windows, read and write the clipboard. Works with macOS, Linux and Windows targets and plugs into
Claude Code (or any MCP client) as a set of tools.

Typical use: your agent is fixing something on a headless Mac mini and hits a dialog that needs
a click. Instead of walking over or opening a KVM, the agent takes a screenshot, clicks the
button, and carries on.

```

```

- **No passwords, tokens or certificates.** `rdc serve` listens only on the machine's Tailscale
  address and asks the local `tailscaled` who each caller is. You allow tailnet logins, device
  names or tags. Your tailnet is the security boundary.
- **Scoped access and an audit trail.** Each allowed identity can be limited to `view`, `input`
  or `clipboard`, and every request or rejection is written to a JSON-lines audit log.
- **No shell.** rdc is a screen-and-input surface only. Use SSH for commands.
- **One binary**, written in Rust. The same executable is the daemon, the CLI and the MCP server.

## Status

| Target platform | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux, Wayland (Hyprland / wlroots) | verified | portal or wlr-screencopy capture, wlr virtual input, `hyprctl` window control |
| Linux, Wayland (GNOME, KDE) | capture only | screenshots via the portal work; synthetic input needs the RemoteDesktop portal, not wired up yet |
| Linux, X11 | compiles, untested | |
| macOS 15+, Apple silicon | verified | needs Screen Recording + Accessibility, see [macOS setup](docs/setup-macos.md) |
| Windows 11 | verified | single display verified; multi-monitor implemented but untested. See [Windows setup](docs/setup-windows.md) |

CI builds and tests all three on every push. Tagged releases attach binaries, which are **not
code-signed** (see [Install](docs/install.md#unsigned-binaries)).

## Five-minute start

**1. Install rdc on both machines.** Download a release archive or `cargo install --git
https://github.com/bscott/rdc`. Details and build dependencies: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

**2. On the machine you want to control**, write the allowlist into the config file, check
readiness, and start the daemon:

```toml
# Linux: ~/.config/rdc/config.toml   macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/rdc/config.toml
# Windows: %APPDATA%\rdc\config.toml
[serve]
allow = [
  "you@example.com",                        # full control: tailnet login, device name, or tag
  { who = "monitor-bot", can = "view" },    # optional: limit an identity to screenshots
]
```

```sh
rdc doctor
rdc serve
```

If your Tailscale policy is not the permissive default, also allow the traffic there. For the
config above, with the controlled machine tagged `tag:rdc-host` and the monitor device tagged
`tag:monitor`:

```jsonc
"grants": [
  { "src": ["you@example.com", "tag:monitor"], "dst": ["tag:rdc-host"], "ip": ["tcp:7770"] },
]
```

The [configuration guide](docs/configuration.md#the-tailscale-side-let-the-traffic-through) maps
every grant example to its policy rule, in both `grants` and legacy `acls` syntax. `rdc doctor` tells you if a permission or `tailscaled` is missing. When it works, install it as a
background service so it survives reboots: `rdc service install` (macOS LaunchAgent or Linux
systemd user service). The service reads the same config file, which is why the allowlist goes
there rather than on the command line. macOS needs two one-time permission grants; follow
[docs/setup-macos.md](docs/setup-macos.md).

**3. On your laptop**, talk to it by Tailscale hostname:

```sh
rdc -t studio-mac whoami                        # the daemon confirms who you are
rdc -t studio-mac shot --max 1568 -o shot.png   # screenshot, downscaled
rdc -t studio-mac click 640 400                 # desktop coordinates
rdc -t studio-mac key cmd+q
```

**4. Give it to your agent.** Add a target to your own machine's config file (same per-platform
paths as above) and register the MCP server in Claude Code:

```toml
[targets.studio-mac]
url = "http://studio-mac.example-tailnet.ts.net:7770"
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "studio-mac": { "command": "rdc", "args": ["mcp", "--target", "studio-mac"] } } }
```

The agent now has `screenshot`, `click`, `type`, `key`, `focus` and friends. It passes pixel
coordinates from the screenshot it just saw; rdc converts them to desktop points. Every action
returns a fresh screenshot so the agent can check its work. Full tool reference:
[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md). An [Agent Skill](skills/rdc/SKILL.md) is included that teaches
agents how to use rdc well.

## How it stays safe

`rdc serve` refuses to bind anything but a Tailscale address (or `127.0.0.1` with the explicit
`--dev-loopback` testing flag, which disables auth). For each request it checks that the `Host`
header names this machine, resolves the peer IP through `tailscaled`'s `whois`, and matches the
login, node name or tags against your grants. Tagged devices are identified by their tags
only, never by the login of whoever created them. An empty allowlist refuses to start. Grants
can be limited to `view`, `input` or `clipboard`, and everything is written to an audit log you
can read with `rdc audit`. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing a machine you care
about.
