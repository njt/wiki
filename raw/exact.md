# Exact

**Write an app once. It runs natively on the web, macOS, iOS, and Linux, and an AI
agent can build it, run it, see it, and test it on every one of them.**

**Building an app?** With the tools installed ([Quick start, step 1](#1-install-the-tools)),
run `bun scripts/exact.mjs setup` once, make the app with `bun scripts/exact.mjs new <path>`,
and read [`docs/start-here.md`](docs/start-here.md) (for a website,
[`docs/start-here-site.md`](docs/start-here-site.md)): that guide is the only required
reading. The rest of this page describes Exact for people deciding whether to use it
or working on it.

> [!TIP]
> **Try it with a coding agent.** On a Mac with Xcode, Rust, Bun, and Chrome installed,
> give Claude Code this prompt:
>
> ```text
> Clone https://github.com/expo/exact and follow its README to make a new Exact
> app with `exact new`. Run `bun scripts/exact.mjs setup` once first. Make a todo
> list where I can add items, check them off, delete them,
> and see how many are left. Put the view in Contract and keep the list in `app.ts`.
> Write an `app.test.contract`, pass it on web, macOS, and the iOS Simulator with
> `scripts/agent.mjs`, then open the app for me on all three.
> ```
>
> A fresh agent given the earlier version of this prompt on a clean clone (2026-10-04, Hermes already in the
> machine cache, Cargo's cache warm) finished in about 57 minutes, and its tests passed
> on all three platforms. About 25 of those minutes were the first macOS and iOS builds,
> roughly 13 minutes each; later builds take a minute or two. On a machine that has
> lacked Hermes, its source build came first and added time. Current setup downloads and
> verifies the pinned host/iOS bundles once instead; ordinary builds stay offline.

Exact is a cross-platform application runtime. You describe your interface in
**Contract**, a small declarative language, and you write your data logic in
**TypeScript or Rust**. The Contract compiler turns the interface into a compact
*plan*. On the web, that plan becomes one ES module over a ~20 KB runtime that drives
the real DOM. On macOS, iOS, and Linux, a Rust runner executes the same plan, a Rust
layout kernel computes every box with CSS rules, and each platform draws with its own
tools: AppKit, UIKit, or a GPU painter. There is no webview and no JavaScript bridge
in the UI, and no app JavaScript runs before the first pixel.

> [!NOTE]
> Exact is pre-1.0 and changes daily. There is no API stability, no backwards
> compatibility, and no migration guide, by design (`rules/DEFERRED.md`). This
> repository, `exact2`, is a rebuild of an earlier one ("exact1"), whose design
> documents are research, never authority.

The design record is a separate, private repository of numbered documents (LLPs),
`expo/exact-llp`, which those with access clone into `llp/` (git ignores it). This
README and the guides cite it by number (`LLP 1115 D7`). The guides under [`docs/`](docs)
are the public documentation.

Upgrade note (2026-10-16): Snapback mutation replies with `ok: false` now throw
`refused(why)` and expose `failure(slot)`; see the
[before/after and inherited-app commands](snapback4/README.md#updating-an-inherited-app).

## Three principles

### 1. Agent native

Exact assumes much of the code will be written by AI agents. An agent can make an app,
run it, look at it, operate it, and prove it works without a person in the loop.

- **Ten operations, the same on every host.** `tree · screenshot · tap · type · state
  · layout · logs · clock · prefer · perf` drive the web, macOS, iOS (Simulator or a real
  iPhone), and Linux through one script, `scripts/agent.mjs`. There are ten on purpose:
  the predecessor's agent API grew to eighty wire names, one reasonable addition at a
  time.
- **The clock belongs to the agent.** Between two operations nothing moves. Instead of
  sleeping until an animation finishes, the agent says `clock +60000` or
  `clock settle` and reads the result. No timing flakes, no waits.
- **Tests are scripts of those operations.** An `app.test.contract` file runs unchanged
  on any host, with no second evaluator.
- **Every tool speaks to machines.** `contract build --json` gives diagnostics with
  stable ids and source ranges. `contract symbols` gives navigation. A development
  source map leads from any node on screen back to the line that declared it.
  The driver refuses to drive a build older than its sources and names the rebuild.
- **Contract is small on purpose.** A whole app fits in a context window. Every write
  is declared, every list is keyed, every value is typed. Mistakes are refusals that
  say what to do, not quiet misbehavior.

```sh
bun scripts/agent.mjs web tree "tap change-station" "type station-search Palo" \
  "clock +60000" state "screenshot out.png"
```

### 2. Speed is king

Speed of the app and speed of the loop. Each budget in `rules/RULES.md` is tracked on
every commit, and a regression is a P0 with a name on it.

| Budget | Target |
|---|---|
| Cold start to interactive first frame | 100 ms p50 |
| Dev restart, edit to present | 100 ms p50 |
| App JavaScript executed before first pixel | none |
| Touch one line, rebuild that crate | 30 s |
| The whole blocking check suite | 65 s |

How the design keeps those numbers:

- **The boot path executes and compiles nothing.** TypeScript is compiled to Hermes
  bytecode at build time and loads after the first pixel. The first frame comes from
  data baked into the plan.
- **Pay only for what you use.** GPU rendering, the Markdown editor, text flow, and
  browser SQLite are separate artifacts, loaded on demand. Nothing is a feature flag
  on a core crate.
- **The web gets its own small runtime.** On the RealWorld ("Conduit") benchmark,
  Exact's runtime was up about 300 ms before the React SSR build had hydrated. It used
  26 KB of code against React's 81 KB
  (LLP 1071).
- **Edits land in about a tenth of a second.** On a fresh app made by `exact new`, a
  saved Contract or TypeScript edit was rebuilt and in the page in 99 ms.

### 3. Write the web, ship the platform

What you write is CSS: the vocabulary, the layout model, the development loop. What you
leave unsaid is the platform's: controls, colour, type, motion, gestures, the keyboard
and accessibility come out as an app built by hand with UIKit or AppKit would have them,
and on the web as a carefully built web app would. What you write wins. The order is
author, then platform, then CSS's default, and one test settles a dispute: would someone
who knows the platform notice? (LLP 1115)

- Layout is CSS's, because a person can't see a layout default, only its result. A bare
  node is `display: block`, `box-sizing: content-box`, `flex-direction: row`,
  `flex-shrink: 1`, the same as a bare `<div>`.
- Names are CSS's, because names are what you write: `font-size`, `object-fit`,
  `text-overflow`, `line-clamp`, `light-dark()`, `env(safe-area-inset-top)`. The compiler
  refuses an alias and names the web's spelling.
- Unsaid presentation is the platform's. Text is the system's label colour and size (17
  points on an iPhone, 13 on a Mac, the reader's setting in a browser), a `button` is the
  system's button, a pushed screen has the system's Back. An app that says less looks
  more at home.
- The browser is the parity oracle for layout and for what you wrote. Native layout
  given the same inputs, Canvas 2D, SVG, gradients, and authored motion are checked
  against what Chrome draws.
- The web is also the development loop. You work on the seconds-long web loop, and the
  native hosts are swept behind you.
- Any unavoidable deviation in layout is declared, with its reason, in LLP 1001. For
  example, Taffy has no `position: static`.

Writing the web doesn't mean the lowest common denominator. Where a platform can do
more (real HTML in an SVG `foreignObject` on the web, MapKit through a native module on
Apple), Exact lets it.

## How it works

```mermaid

  D -.->|answers, checked against declared shapes| W
  D -.-> R
```

- **Contract** (`contract/`) is compiled in four passes: syntax, types, analysis, and
  lowering. At build time the plan is *baked*: constant data is evaluated into it, so
  the first frame needs nothing else.
- **The runner** (`runner/`) is the plan's virtual machine. It handles keyed component
  instances, events, timers on a seekable clock, and the data seam.
- **The kernel** (`kernel/`) is a columnar node arena with CSS layout through a patched
  [Taffy](vendor/taffy/EXACT-PATCHES.md). The host measures text: CoreText on Apple,
  cosmic-text on Linux. On the web, the browser lays out the same CSS itself, so the web
  build carries no layout engine.
- **Hosts** (`host/`) present the tree. The web host writes DOM nodes, and the browser
  runs CSS transitions. The Apple host is a static library with a C ABI under AppKit and
  UIKit presenters. The Linux host paints the tree itself, onto DRM/KMS with evdev
  input, or into an offscreen buffer.
- **Data sources** sit below one seam. TypeScript runs on Hermes on native hosts and in
  the browser's own engine on the web. Rust runs natively, and can be replaced live
  (as a shared library, or as Wasm on iOS and the web). Every answer is checked against
  the shape Contract declared. Grants control network, files, SQLite, and secrets.
- **Optional pieces** are separate artifacts: a wgpu GPU module (Metal on Apple, WebGPU
  in the browser), native modules (a hyphenated tag backed by a platform widget, like
  MapKit), and a [game engine](game/README.md) add-on.

## Quick start

These steps were run on macOS on Apple Silicon. Linux also runs the web loop, the
Linux host, and the iOS cross compiler. On Windows, use WSL 2 with Ubuntu 24.04 for iOS builds.

### 1. Install the tools

- **Rust** through [rustup](https://rustup.rs). The pinned stable toolchain in
  `rust-toolchain.toml` installs itself the first time Cargo runs.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4.2**, the version `package.json` pins. Node and npm are
  not needed.
- **Google Chrome.** The agent drives the web through headless Chrome. Set `CHROME` to
  use another Chromium.
- **Xcode 27.1 or later**, for Apple builds on macOS (`exact setup --check` checks it). For iOS builds on Linux/WSL, install
  [Swift 6.4.2](https://www.swift.org/install/linux/),
  [xtool 1.24.0](https://github.com/xtool-org/xtool/releases/tag/1.24.0),
  [LLVM 23](https://apt.llvm.org/), and
  [apple-codesign 0.29.0](https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs/releases/tag/apple-codesign%2F0.29.0).
  Download Xcode 27.1 from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode%2027.1),
  then run `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 xtool sdk install --slim /path/to/Xcode_27.1.xip` on Linux. This extracts the SDK;
  it does not run Xcode. The environment variable lets xtool's AppImage run without FUSE.
  In WSL 2, keep the checkout and SDK in Ubuntu's Linux filesystem. Put LLVM's `bin` directory on `PATH` and set
  `EXACT_APPLE_LLVM_BIN` to that directory (on Ubuntu, `/usr/lib/llvm-23/bin`).
  Swift and `rcodesign` must also be on `PATH`; IPA archives also need `zip`.
  For a signed device archive, set `EXACT_IDENTITY` to an absolute PKCS#12 file path,
  `EXACT_APPLE_SIGN_PASSWORD_FILE` to its password file, and `EXACT_PROFILE` to the
  app’s provisioning profile. Set `EXACT_PROFILE_DIR` to a directory containing
  companion extension profiles. Profile decoding needs `openssl`.
  On macOS, `EXACT_IDENTITY` continues to name a Keychain identity.
  `EXACT_APPLE_SDK` can select a Darwin
  SDK bundle outside xtool's default `~/.swiftpm/swift-sdks/darwin.artifactbundle`.
  Watch simulator companions require `xtool sdk install /path/to/Xcode_27.1.xip`
  without `--slim`, so Exact can install the retained watch SDK on the first watch build.
  Icon Composer projects retain their live SVG layers on iOS 26 and newer; Linux
  uses the manifest’s PNG `icons` entry as artwork for older iOS versions. The
  portable compiler supports the checked-in projects’ default SVG group and
  opaque sRGB background; other Composer settings are refused explicitly.
  For the SVG filter kernels and Canvas 2D GPU module on x86-64 Linux/WSL,
  install Wine 9 or newer and download [Metal Developer Tools for Windows](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tools/).
  Extract the installer with `7z x -o/path/to/metal-tools Metal_Developer_Tools6.2Windows.exe`,
  then set `EXACT_APPLE_METAL_TOOLS=/path/to/metal-tools` (the directory containing `bin/metal.exe`).
  The qualified compiler is Metal 32023.850 from the 6.2 Windows installer.
  `EXACT_APPLE_WINE` can select Wine's executable; otherwise Exact uses Ubuntu's
  `/usr/lib/wine/wine64` when present, then `wine` on PATH. Wine runs only at build
  time. Its prefix defaults to `~/.cache/exact/windows-metal`; `WINEPREFIX` overrides it.
- **Hermes**, only for TypeScript apps on native hosts. Exact consumes Ibex's
  pinned, attested `260318099.0.4` release bundle; ordinary Cargo builds are
  offline and never download or compile an engine. Install it once for each
  target before building (for this Mac, use `aarch64-apple-darwin`):

  ```sh
  cargo run --manifest-path vendor/ibex/crates/hermes-lean-sys-installer/Cargo.toml -- --target <triple>
  ```

  The installer verifies the bundle and publishes it under
  `~/.cargo/hermes-lean-sys/`. The v4 set supports macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS
  devices and the universal iOS Simulator, plus tvOS devices and arm64 tvOS
  Simulators. Linux and Windows select Ibex's English `intl` tier; Apple keeps
  Hermes's OS-backed Intl.
  `HERMES_LEAN_SYS_DIR` is only an explicit development
  override, not normal setup.

To install the pinned Bun beside any existing installation:
`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | BUN_INSTALL=~/.bun-1.4.2 bash -s bun-v1.4.2`.
Use `~/.bun-1.4.2/bin/bun` for the commands below if it is not on your PATH.
`bun scripts/exact.mjs setup` installs the declared stable and web nightly Rust
toolchains, their components/targets (the nightly's clippy lints a game's web bake),
matching wasm-bindgen, pinned Binaryen and Bun dependencies, installs the pinned
Hermes host bundle and the iOS/tvOS bundles this machine builds, and fetches the crates
of exact2's lock and the game SDK's (`game/app/shells.lock`), since every bake
resolves offline. It keeps Binaryen in `~/.cache/exact/binaryen`; builds find it
automatically. `setup --check` invokes Ibex's installer in its offline check mode for
that same target set. The resolver authenticates the canonical receipts, archives,
compiler and host/target HBC pairing without installing anything; its exit status and
diagnostic are the check's result.

With the Linux cross SDK installed, `setup` also installs the iOS Rust targets.
Build a simulator bundle with `bun host/apple/build.mjs --ios --no-install hello-apple`.
In an app made with `exact new`, `bun exact.mjs ios` builds without installing on Linux/WSL;
`ios --prebuild` runs the same build in the background.
Linux defaults to an ARM64 simulator target; `EXACT_IOS_SIM_ARCH=x86_64` selects an
Intel simulator. Execution needs an iOS simulator on macOS or an iPhone; compilation,
asset catalog generation, App Intents metadata and ad-hoc signing run on Linux.

Production builds with custom native views also validate the compiled factory roster.
Linux can import a simulator qualification with `EXACT_NATIVE_ROSTERS=/path/to/qualification.json`.
It contains `{ "version": 1, "probes": [{ "probeSha256": "…", "roster": "<JSON object>" }] }`.
The build writes `native-probes.json` beside its link products to identify the probe to
execute on an iOS simulator. Qualifications match the probe's SHA-256; changing its
compiled bytes requires a new simulator run. Without a matching qualification, a
production build refuses rather than accepting an absent factory or omitting its
first-frame declaration. Development builds retain the existing manifest fallback.

### 2. Run Caltrain in the browser

```sh
git clone https://github.com/expo/exact.git
cd exact
bun scripts/exact.mjs setup
bun host/web/dev.mjs            # Caltrain, at http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

The first run compiles the toolchain, which takes a few minutes. After that, open
[`apps/caltrain/app.contract`](apps/caltrain/app.contract), change some text, and save.
The page rebuilds and reloads in about a tenth of a second. Add `--lan` to open the
same page from a phone on your network. The server answers only to the names it
prints (a DNS-rebinding guard; any other `Host` gets 421); to share it through a
tunnel such as `tuft host`, name the tunnel's host with `--allow-host <name>`
(repeatable; `name:port` pins a port). An allowed name reaches the page and its
reload stream, never the local installer's token.

### 3. Run it natively

```sh
bun host/apple/build.mjs --run              # macOS
bun host/apple/build.mjs --ios --run        # an iOS Simulator (--device --run for a connected iPhone)
cargo build --profile host-dev -p caltrain-linux   # Linux: a DRM/KMS console, or headless anywhere (--release to ship)
```

A first native build takes ten to fifteen minutes on a laptop; later builds reuse it
and take a minute or two. Watch its output rather than waiting blind. iOS commands use an
iPhone simulator that's already booted, or boot the newest iPhone Pro. To choose one,
set `EXACT_SIM` to its name or UDID (or pass `--sim` to `build.mjs`), and keep the same
setting for `agent.mjs ios`.

On Linux, a development build can serve its screen with `EXACT_VNC=1` and
`EXACT_VNC_PASSWORD` set to 1–8 bytes. It listens on `127.0.0.1:5900`;
an explicit `EXACT_VNC=host:port` selects another address. Production bakes
ignore both variables.

### 4. Drive it the way an agent does

```sh
bun host/web/build.mjs caltrain-web         # the build the agent's web host serves
bun scripts/agent.mjs web tree "tap change-station" "type station-search Palo" state "screenshot out.png"
bun scripts/agent.mjs web --test apps/caltrain/app.test.contract
```

Swap `web` for `macos`, `ios`, or `linux` once that host is built. Caltrain's three
tests take about two seconds on the web host. Each operation is one shell argument, so
quote it: `"type new-todo Buy milk"` types `Buy milk` (everything after the target is
the text). `"screenshot film.png over 600 every 50"`
films motion as a contact sheet; use an `.apng` name to get an animation.

### 5. Make your own app

```sh
bun scripts/exact.mjs new ../hello          # or run `bun link` once, then `exact new ../hello`
cd ../hello
bun exact.mjs contract types app.contract -o app.contract.d.ts   # first run builds the compiler
bun exact.mjs web                           # the dev loop, at http://127.0.0.1:8765/
bun exact.mjs test web                      # the app's *.test.contract, or the files named
bun exact.mjs mac --run                     # this Mac
bun exact.mjs ios --run                     # an iOS Simulator
```

`exact new` creates a standalone app: `app.contract` (the view), `app.ts` (its data),
`app.json` (the manifest: name, bundle id, hosts, deploy policy) and `app.test.contract`
(its test). Its `AGENTS.md` (and `CLAUDE.md`) points a coding agent at
[`docs/start-here.md`](docs/start-here.md), the one guide it must read, and at `bun
exact.mjs help` for the commands, including `bun exact.mjs contract …` for the compiler
and `contract vocab` for the card of what an app writes (`--all`: every tag and property Contract accepts). Before any of
it, run `bun scripts/exact.mjs setup` once; `setup --check` names everything this machine
is missing without changing it. The app holds no crate: a native verb (`mac`, `ios`,
`linux`, `android`, `windows`) builds in a Cargo workspace it generates under
`.exact/shells/`, which uses your exact2 checkout by path. To drive it from exact2,
point `EXACT_APP_DIR` at it:

```sh
EXACT_APP_DIR=../hello bun host/web/build.mjs hello-web
EXACT_APP_DIR=../hello bun scripts/agent.mjs web --app hello tree "screenshot hello.png"
```

Look at every screenshot, not just the test result: a test passes on a layout that
spills off the screen. `bun exact.mjs agent <host> "screenshot out.png"` shows the app
on each host in its own session; for a copy you launched yourself, use
`xcrun simctl io <device> screenshot out.png` on iOS.

`bun scripts/exact.mjs` also runs apps from this repository as real Mac apps:
`exact run markdown README.md`, or `exact install markdown` to put `mdview` on your
`PATH`. `exact list` shows what's here.

### Feedback

An app's `AGENTS.md` asks its agent to record friction in one line, `bun exact.mjs
feedback note "<what happened>"`. A failed or slow drive, build or verify, and a passing
`test` or `verify`, end with one line naming it, at most once a day per project. A note stays in the app's
`.exact/` with exact2's commit, the last command's verb, exit code and duration, and the
OS; never any command output, or the app's code or files. It goes to Expo (`https://exact-diaries.ccheever-0f6.workers.dev`) only when
the project's answer allows: `always`, or a yes to `ask`, the default, after
`bun exact.mjs feedback` shows exactly what would go. `bun exact.mjs feedback never`
stops it for a project; `EXACT_FEEDBACK=0` silences the nudges and refuses every send
on the machine. [docs/diary.md](docs/diary.md) has the details.

## Contract

An agent building an app starts at [start-here.md](docs/start-here.md), the only
required reading, then looks up the [recipe](docs/recipes/) for each question. For more, read the complete [guide for humans](docs/contract-for-humans.md),
or look things up in the [guide for agents](docs/contract-for-agents.md) or the
[grammar and vocabulary reference](docs/contract-grammar.md).

Contract describes what an app shows and how its state changes. It doesn't fetch, read
files, or run arbitrary code. That's what data sources are for. Here is a complete todo
app: a Contract file, a TypeScript file, and a test. This exact app was built for web,
macOS, and the iOS Simulator, and its test passed on all three.

To try it in an app created with `exact new`, replace `app.contract`, `app.ts` and
`app.test.contract` with the examples below.

```contract
// app.contract: the view, its state, and what each action changes. It names no colour,
// font or control size: each host draws its own heading, field, button, checkbox and list.
shape Todo
  id: string
  title: string
  done: bool

shape Change
  count: number

component Todos
  state draft = ""
  mutation changed as shape Change refreshes todos
  resource todos = todos() as shape Todo[]
  derive left = todos.filter(t => not t.done).length

  action edit(value: string)
    draft = value
  action add
    if draft.trim() != ""
      send changed = addTodo(draft.trim())
      draft = ""
  action toggle(id: string, done: bool)
    send changed = setDone(id, done)
  action remove(id: string)
    send changed = removeTodo(id)

  view
    list appearance="auto" height="100%"
      section
        header
          text `${left} left` role="heading" testId="count"
        row
          input value=draft input=edit submit=add placeholder="What needs doing?" aria-label="New todo" testId="new-todo" flex=1 min-width=0
          button press=add buttonStyle="filled" testId="add"
            text "Add"
      section
        for t in todos key=t.id
          row delete=remove(t.id) testId=`todo-${t.id}`
            input type="checkbox" checked=t.done change=toggle(t.id) aria-label=t.title testId=`toggle-${t.id}`
            text t.title flex=1
            button press=remove(t.id) destructive=true testId=`remove-${t.id}`
              text "Delete"
```

```ts
// app.ts: keeps the list, and answers what app.contract asks for
import type { Answer, Sources } from './app.contract.d.ts';

export const grants = '';  // e.g. 'net.fetch https://api.example.com'

type Todo = { id: string; title: string; done: boolean };
let todos: Todo[] = [];
let next = 1;

const sources: Sources = {
  todos: () => todos,
  addTodo: ([title]) => {
    todos = [...todos, { id: String(next++), title, done: false }];
    return { count: todos.length };
  },
  setDone: ([id, done]) => {
    todos = todos.map((t) => (t.id === id ? { ...t, done } : t));
    return { count: todos.length };
  },
  removeTodo: ([id]) => {
    todos = todos.filter((t) => t.id !== id);
    return { count: todos.length };
  },
};

export const answer: Answer = (source, args, store, storage, native) =>

The view never edits the list itself. An action `send`s a *mutation* to a source,
`app.ts` changes its data and answers, and `refreshes todos` asks for the list again.
Data lives in one place, and every change to it is a named, typed call an agent can see.
This list lives in memory. To keep it across launches, give `app.ts` a grant like
`sqlite.open app:/data/todos.db` and use `storage.sqlite`, as
[Fieldnotes](apps/fieldnotes) does.

### The pieces

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| `shape` | A closed record type. Fields are `number`, `string`, `bool`, another shape, `option<T>`, or `T[]`. |
| `component` | A unit of UI. The first one in a file is the root. Components take `props`, can `inject` what an ancestor `provide`s, and can fill a `slot` with `children`. |
| `state` | A value the component owns, its type inferred or declared (`state picked: option<Item> = none`). Under a `for`, child state belongs to that keyed row. |
| `derive` | A value computed from others, recomputed when they change. |
| `resource` | Data from a source: `resource x = source(args) as shape T`. When the arguments change, the source is asked again. |
| `mutation` / `send` | A change made through a source: `send x = source(args)`. `refreshes r` asks resource `r` again afterward, `pending(x)` and `failed(x)` show progress, and `failure(x)` says why a resource failed. |
| `action` | The only place state changes. What it writes is inferred from its body, and `let` binds a local inside it. |
| `task` | Work on a schedule: `every(1000, tick)`, `after(ms, a)`, `every(frame, a)`. |
| `view` | Indented elements, `if … else`, `for … key=…` (a key is required), `match` over options, and calls to other components. |
| `style` / `class=` | A named set of CSS properties. The node's own attributes win, and there is no cascade. |
| `fn`, `xs.map` / `xs.filter` / `xs.join` | Pure, single-expression helpers. Recursion is refused. |
| Built-in functions | The web's string and array methods by their names, called on the value (`xs.length`, `s.trim()`, `s.includes(t)`, `xs.at(-1)`), and functions (`first(xs)`, `formatDate`, `formatNumber`); all are listed with their types under `stdlib` in [`plan/tables/format.json`](plan/tables/format.json). |
| `routes` | A router: a location and a retained stack per tab, moved with `open`, `push`, `replace`, and `back`, and read with `top`. |
| `font` | Declares a font family and binds it to files at build time. |
| `use … from "./x.contract"` | Imports components, shapes, styles, and `fn`s from another Contract file. |
| `testId` | A stable name for the agent, tests, and accessibility tools. |

### What Contract leaves out, and why

- **No JavaScript in the view, and no I/O.** Expressions have no effects. Effects
  happen only in actions, as assignments, `send`, `refresh`, or commands like
  `focus(…)` and `share(…)`. Data crosses one seam: a source answers, and the runner
  checks the answer.
- **No loops in actions, no `await`.** A list is a view's keyed `for`, a computation is a `derive` or a
  `fn` (an action may name a value with `let`), and anything slower lives in a
  source. A list that changes changes where its data lives, through a mutation, as
  in the example above. That's what lets the plan be baked, diffed, inspected, and
  executed the same way on four hosts.
- **No escape hatch; access hatches.** Nothing steps outside the plan. Where an app
  needs a platform widget, it uses a *native module*: a hyphenated tag like
  `exact-map`, backed by Swift, Kotlin or Rust, laid out by the kernel like any other box.
  Where it needs the platform object Exact itself built (a `UIView`, a navigation
  controller, a DOM element), it marks the node `hatch="word"` and its native code is
  handed that object: an *access hatch*, the panel a machine is built with so its
  insides can be reached. It configures what Exact made and changes Contract state
  only by acting on authored nodes, as a person would.

These limits serve the principles. An agent can't wire up a data race it can't write.
A plan with no JavaScript in it starts fast. A view written in CSS's own words lays out
the same on every host and looks at home on each.

### The compiler talks back

```sh
$ cargo run -q -p contract -- build app.contract
app.contract:4:5 [type-assign] `count` is `number`, cannot assign `string`
app.contract:7:23 [lower-unknown-attr] `text` has no attribute `size`; `size` is spelled `font-size` here, the web's name (LLP 1017 §8.1)
```

One run reports up to twenty independent errors, not just the first. Other subcommands:
`--json` for tools, `symbols` (definitions and references as JSON), `fmt`
(source-preserving), `types` (generates `app.contract.d.ts` for TypeScript sources),
and `rust` (shapes for a Rust data crate). The full language is in
[the grammar reference](docs/contract-grammar.md); its design is LLP 1006, LLP 1017.000
(v1.1), LLP 1017.003 and, for data sources, LLP 1027.

## Example apps

Each app lives in [`apps/<name>/`](apps). Run one on the web with
`bun host/web/dev.mjs --app <name>`, on macOS with
`bun host/apple/build.mjs <name>-apple --run`, and on iOS by adding `--ios`. All of
these screenshots come from the web host, taken by `scripts/agent.mjs`.

To learn from, start with [Shelf](apps/shelf), the recipe app. It names no colour and no
font size, and `scripts/no-tells.mjs` holds it to that, so it shows what an app that
leaves presentation to the platform looks like on each host. Then read these four for
what each teaches. They were written before LLP 1115
and paint their own colours and sizes, so take their structure, not their style:

| App | What it teaches |
|---|---|
| [Caltrain](apps/caltrain) | A Rust data crate, authored tests, routes, an optional GPU module |
| [Weatherlight](apps/weatherlight) | TypeScript with `fetch` and grants |
| [Fieldnotes](apps/fieldnotes) | Storage: SQLite, files, backup and restore |
| [Recorder](apps/recorder) | The microphone through `@exact/media-capture` and `@exact/recording` |

## What works today, and what doesn't yet

The v1 bar, from `rules/DEFERRED.md`: *one real application, not a demo, runs from a
single Contract source on web, macOS, iOS, and Linux, within the time budgets in
`rules/RULES.md`.* Caltrain is that application, and it runs on all four. Everything
else here was admitted because a real app needed it.

### Working

- **Four hosts.** Web, macOS (AppKit, no SwiftUI), iOS (UIKit, on the Simulator and
  on devices), and Linux (GPU or CPU painting, DRM/KMS or headless). Existing Swift apps
  can embed Exact sessions through ExactKit
  (LLP 1031).
- **Layout and text.** CSS block, flex, and grid; `position: static` and containing
  blocks; `aspect-ratio`; declared fonts; text around shapes
  (LLP 1043.000).
- **Paint.** Gradients, shadows, `backdrop-filter`, glass materials, complete SVG
  (LLP 1055), Canvas 2D on every host
  (LLP 1056), and a wgpu GPU canvas loaded after first
  pixel.
- **Motion.** CSS transitions, springs, `@keyframes`, follow-and-release gestures (pan,
  swipe, pinch) with release velocity, layout transitions, exit animations, and
  drag-linked timelines (LLP 1002,
  LLP 1063,
  LLP 1057.003); a scroller is not yet a
  timeline's source.
- **Lists.** Virtualized lists, vertical or horizontal, one level deep
  (LLP 1070). The rows of a vertical
  `list` are its platform's: UIKit's separators and highlight, a table on the Mac, one
  line between rows on the web, with nothing drawn by the app
  (LLP 1115.000, D16).
- **Controls and media.** Inputs, `select`, a WYSIWYG Markdown editor on the web, macOS,
  and iOS (LLP 1045), images including animated
  ones, video (LLP 1042), pickers for an app's declared file
  types, and share.
- **Camera.** [`@exact/camera`](packages/camera/exact.json) shows a live viewfinder
  (`exact-camera srcObject=`) and takes still photos (`takePhoto`) on the web, iOS,
  macOS, and Android, behind the `device.camera` grant (LLP 1133.008). It does not
  record video from the camera or hand its frames to code, and it has no Windows,
  Linux, tvOS, or watchOS implementation.
- **Data.** TypeScript or Rust sources, optionally on a worker. Grant-checked `fetch` and
  streams, files and SQLite (native and in the browser), Keychain secrets, and OAuth
  sign-in. A router keeps a stack per tab (LLP 1038).
- **Native modules.** Platform widgets as hyphenated tags
  (LLP 1024).
- **The web, server side.** Pages pre-rendered at build time or per request by a Rust
  renderer, then adopted in place instead of hydrated
  (LLP 1048).
- **Delivery.** `scripts/deploy.mjs` publishes the web root and signed update bundles,
  which installed apps fetch after first pixel. Apple apps check every fifteen
  minutes while active under every activation policy; `deploy.check.interval`
  overrides the interval in seconds. Checks stage a candidate; `deploy.activate`
  controls when it applies. TypeScript and Rust logic can be
  replaced live in development. Every web build gets an install page, and
  `exact release` signs and notarizes a Mac app
  (LLP 1030).
- **Agents and tests.** The ten operations on every host, including a physical
  iPhone; Contract tests; source maps; filmed screenshots.

### Not yet, or not at all

- **Windows.** Apps default to ink on a DirectX 11 composition swap chain,
  or CPU when the manifest declares `game`. `host.windows.painter: "ink"`
  or `"cpu"` selects either painter, and `EXACT_PAINTER` overrides both.
  Skirmish is a standalone game built with Exact's optional game engine;
  the CPU default preserves its module-owned window presentation (LLP 1149 D12).
  [Windows Desk](apps/windows-desk/README.md) demonstrates
  native controls over Contract and the kernel with an app-local Win32 presenter;
  general Windows control parity and delivery remain unfinished.
  Notification-area icons are not built: `-exact-menu="status"` stays an
  ordinary button in the window (LLP 1133.025 §14).
- **Android.** Admitted (2026-10-07) and early. An app builds for Android and runs
  on an emulator or a phone: `bun exact.mjs android` builds it, `bun exact.mjs test
  android` runs its tests, and `bun exact.mjs agent android …` drives it
  (LLP 1107). It needs the Android SDK,
  the Rust target `aarch64-linux-android`, and the Hermes Android bundle, which
  `exact setup` installs with the target. `bun exact.mjs android --bundle`
  produces a signed release App Bundle; the [phone release recipe](docs/recipes/mobile-build.md)
  names the upload-key and version inputs. Play upload and store submission
  remain the publisher's work.
- **No JSX or React tier.** Nothing runs JavaScript above the data seam. The door stays
  open, but no one is building it.
- **Code updates in production.** Signed delivery covers plans, assets and one
  module pair: Apple accepts TypeScript or an enabled Rust module, Linux a Rust
  module only, and Windows has no update store. The installed binary's runtime,
  app identity, grants and Rust policy still bind. Delivering TypeScript and Rust
  modules together is not implemented.
- **Linux editing.** The web and Apple hosts edit; Linux reads. Linux also has no
  word segmenter, so flowed Thai, Lao, Khmer, and Myanmar text breaks only at spaces.
- **Out on purpose for v1.** A gesture arena, general layout animation, grid or
  masonry virtualization, a general webview beyond `iframe`, and a devtools UI.
- **No packaged CLI.** You work from a source checkout. `exact new` apps refer to it by
  path.

[`QUEUE.md`](QUEUE.md) lists what would make sense to do next.

## Working on Exact

Start with [`rules/RULES.md`](rules/RULES.md), one page on how work happens here, and
[`rules/DEFERRED.md`](rules/DEFERRED.md), what v1 deliberately leaves out. Agents should
also read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). In short:

- **Six blocking checks, 65 seconds in total.** Anything slower runs asynchronously,
  per commit.

  ```sh
  cargo build --all-targets --keep-going
  cargo test --tests --no-fail-fast
  cargo clippy --all-targets --keep-going -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --all -- --check
  bun scripts/caps.mjs     # budgets: 1,500 lines per source file, document caps
  bun scripts/boot.mjs     # counts the module graph before first pixel
  cargo check --workspace --all-targets --keep-going   # every crate compiles
  ```

  The first three build and test Cargo's `default-members`. The last compiles every
  other crate too, so a host or an app outside them cannot stop compiling unseen. It
  needs the pinned Bun (`package.json`) first on `PATH`: app crates' build scripts run it.

- **Verify by running, not by reading.** Build the app a change touches and drive it:
  `bun scripts/smoke.mjs <web|macos|ios|linux>` drives the whole app on that host.
- **Delete; don't deprecate.** Before 1.0 there are no compatibility shims. Generated
  files are built, never committed.
- **Agents remove apparatus freely and add none** (checks, scripts, registries, design
  documents) without a person saying so.
- **Design happens in LLPs.** These are the numbered documents of the design record. A spec gets
  written only when it has an implementer and a date.

Detailed operational notes cover toolchains, the Contract CLI's JSON formats, source
maps, TypeScript and Rust data modules, storage, live replacement, delivery trust, the
install page, and the stress harnesses. They're in
[`docs/reference.md`](docs/reference.md). Open issues are files under
[`issues/`](issues) ([how that works](docs/issues.md)).

The workspace is MIT-licensed (`Cargo.toml`).

The Snapback client (`snapback4/`) is not in this repository, and Exact works without it:
in a checkout without it, `exact new --snapback` and `bun exact.mjs snapback` refuse,
naming the missing client. A checkout that has it there uses published **0.4.33** with
the matching immutable Rust source revision `3653cae823145170df3e720f5e321bd1b5b4d79d`,
and [its guide](snapback4/README.md) covers wiring and device rebuilds.
