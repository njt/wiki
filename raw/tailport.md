# tailport

A terminal UI that lists your machine's locally listening TCP ports and lets
you toggle `tailscale serve --http=<port>` on or off for each one — a quick
way to expose a local dev server to your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
tailnet (your private WireGuard network) at `http://<hostname>:<port>`,
without touching a terminal or remembering `tailscale serve` syntax.

This is a personal tool built for a specific home tailnet setup (a handful
of Linux and macOS machines). It's shared as-is in case it's useful to
someone else, but it isn't a general-purpose product and makes no promises
about working outside that kind of setup.

## Security model

By default, tailport exposes ports only to your **tailnet** — the private
network of devices you've authenticated into Tailscale — by shelling out to
`tailscale serve` (plain HTTP, tailnet-only).

It can also expose a port to the **public internet**, but only as an explicit
opt-in: the `P` key funnels the selected port via `tailscale funnel`, behind
a strong y/n confirmation. Funnel is HTTPS-only and uses one of Tailscale's
three public ingress ports (443, 8443, 10000), so a funnelled port is
reachable by anyone on the internet — not just your tailnet. Public exposure
is never automatic; it happens only when you press `P` and confirm, `:22`
(SSH) is refused outright, and funnelled ports are drawn with a distinct
marker (`●` / 🐦).

Two deliberate constraints on the tailnet-`serve` path:

- **Plain HTTP** (`tailscale serve --http=<port>`), never HTTPS/TLS serve
  mode. Tailscale's WireGuard tunnel already encrypts traffic between tailnet
  peers, so app-layer TLS on top wouldn't add real confidentiality here — it
  would just add certificate handling for no benefit. (Funnel is necessarily
  HTTPS, since it faces the public internet.)
- **1:1 port mapping.** A tailnet-served port always keeps its own number
  (same port in and out); serve never remaps to a different number. Funnel is
  the deliberate exception — it maps your local port onto one of the public
  ingress ports (443/8443/10000), which won't match the local number.

## Requirements

- The [`tailscale`](https://tailscale.com/download) CLI installed,
  authenticated, and connected to a tailnet with
  [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns) enabled (so
  `http://<hostname>:<port>` resolves for your other tailnet devices).
- Run this once so tailport can call `tailscale serve` without root:
  ```sh
  sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER
  ```
- Linux (uses `ss` for port discovery) or macOS (uses `lsof`). Other
  platforms aren't supported.
- Prebuilt release binaries are published for `linux/amd64`,
  `linux/arm64`, and `darwin/arm64` (see Install below). Other
  OS/architecture combinations require building from source with `go
  install`.

## Install

**On Arch Linux**, from the AUR. [`tailport`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tailport)
builds from source; [`tailport-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tailport-bin)
drops in the prebuilt release binary and needs no Go toolchain. They conflict
with each other by design — install one:

```sh
paru -S tailport        # or: yay -S tailport
paru -S tailport-bin    # prebuilt
```

**On macOS or Linux**, from the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap. It builds from
source, so it works on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs alike, and on Linuxbrew:

```sh
brew install gruen/tap/tailport
```

**With Go installed**, for any supported OS/arch:

```sh
go install github.com/gruen/tailport/cmd/tailport@latest
```

**Without Go**, on Linux (`amd64`/`arm64`) or macOS (`arm64`), fetch a
prebuilt binary from this repo's
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gruen/tailport/releases) using the
bundled install script. Either run it after cloning:

```sh
./install.sh
```

or fetch and run it directly:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruen/tailport/main/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your OS and architecture, downloads the matching binary
from the latest release, verifies it against the release's published
`sha256` checksum, and installs it to `~/.local/bin/tailport`. Override the
destination directory with `TAILPORT_INSTALL_DIR`, or pin a specific release
with `TAILPORT_VERSION` (e.g. `TAILPORT_VERSION=0.1.1`; a leading `v` is
accepted too) instead of taking the latest. Release binaries are built by
`.github/workflows/build.yml` on tagged pushes (`v*`); if that workflow's
build matrix doesn't cover your platform, use `go install` instead.

Re-running the script is version-aware and safe to script into a cron job or
dotfiles bootstrap:

- If the version already installed matches the target, it prints
  `already up to date` and does nothing.
- If the upgrade (or downgrade) isn't breaking, it backs up the previous
  binary to `tailport.bak` next to the install, installs the new one, and
  prints the old → new version.
- If the transition **is** breaking — a **major** version change (a `0.x`
  minor bump is *not* breaking; it upgrades like any other) — the script
  refuses to install and exits non-zero, leaving the existing binary
  untouched. Review the release notes, then opt in explicitly with
  `TAILPORT_ALLOW_BREAKING=1` to install anyway (this also backs up the old
  binary first). This gate is skipped, with a note, only when the
  currently-installed binary's version can't be determined (e.g. it predates
  `--version` support).

A rolling backup (`~/.local/bin/tailport.bak`, or `$TAILPORT_INSTALL_DIR/tailport.bak`)
is kept whenever the script replaces an existing install; roll back with
`mv ~/.local/bin/tailport.bak ~/.local/bin/tailport`.

The default install directory, `~/.local/bin`, isn't on every system's
`PATH`. If the `tailport` command isn't found after installing, add it to
your shell's rc file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, …):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

Run `tailport`. It scans locally listening TCP ports and shows how each one
is actually reachable — localhost only, already on your tailnet, or served
(and to whom).

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `space` | Toggle `tailscale serve` (tailnet-only) on/off for the selected port — only offered for a loopback-bound port; an already-reachable (tailnet/LAN) port shows an info toast instead |
| `P` | Funnel the selected port to the **public internet** via `tailscale funnel`, behind a strong y/n confirm (`:22` refused). Press again to drop it back to tailnet-served |
| `c` | Copy the selected port's URL to the clipboard (via OSC 52, so it works over SSH). It copies the URL for the port's current exposure — a **published** port's public `https://…`, a LAN bind's LAN address, a localhost-only/offline port's `http://localhost:…`, otherwise the tailnet URL (served/tailnet/funnel). The copy is confirmed inline with a ✓, or by a toast naming the exact URL copied |
| `C` | Tear down stale forwards — ports still served with nothing listening locally. Offered only when some exist |
| `x` | Lock / unlock the selected port. A locked port can't be served until unlocked; `:22` is locked by default and unlocking it requires typing `ssh` |
| `n` | Add a port by number to Favorites (even one nothing is listening on yet). It does **not** serve — press `space` there to serve it once its service is up |
| `l` | Label the selected port with custom text (prefilled with its current label if set, else the process name) |
| `f` | Favorite the selected port, pinning it to the default view |
| `F` | Forget the selected port: clears its ★ and drops it from the default view |
| `u` | Undo the last registry edit (favorite, forget, label, lock, add) — session-only, and never touches what's exposed |
| `ctrl+r` | Redo the last undone registry edit |
| `a` | Toggle between the default view and showing every listening port |
| `/` | Filter by port number, process, or label (fuzzy) |
| `r` | Refresh the port list and serve status |
| `?` | Toggle the full help overlay |
| `q` / `ctrl+c` | Quit |

Each row's leading marker encodes the port's state — listening, served on
tailnet, public (funnel), or served-but-nothing-listening; see
[Status markers](#status-markers) below for the exact glyphs. The
description below the port name spells out who can actually reach it:
`localhost only` (loopback-bound, unserved), `on tailnet` (already
reachable — e.g. a wildcard-bound `sshd` on `:22` — no serving needed),
`local network only` (bound to a specific LAN IP, not the tailnet), the
served `http://<hostname>:<port>` URL, or the funnelled public HTTPS URL. A
favorited port additionally shows a star (★). The name shown next
to a port is its custom label if you've set one, otherwise its resolved
process name (or `was <name>` for a favorite whose process has since exited)
— or `?` if that can't be determined, which happens when the port belongs to
a process owned by a different user (most commonly `root`) than the one
running tailport.

### Default view and the port registry

tailport doesn't show every listening port by default — that gets noisy
fast (sshd, mDNS, Docker, browsers holding sockets open, etc.). Instead it
shows the union of:

- ports currently served via `tailscale serve`, and
- ports in the **registry**: anything you've ever toggled on, labeled, or
  favorited.

A port earns a place in the registry the moment you interact with it —
serving it (`space`), adding it by number (`n`), labeling it (`l`),
favoriting it (`f`), or locking it (`x`) all add it. Once a port is in the
registry it keeps showing up, marked inactive, even after you toggle it off —
and that persists across restarts, not just for the current session. `F`
(forget) on a port that has no label and isn't locked reverses this: it's
dropped from the registry and disappears from the default view (unless it's
currently active).

Registry edits are undoable within a session: `u` steps back through them one
at a time and `ctrl+r` steps forward. Undo covers only the registry —
favorites, labels, locks, adds. It never changes what's actually exposed:
serve and funnel have their own keys and confirms, and undo won't flip them
behind your back. For the same reason it won't unlock `:22`, since that needs
a deliberate typed confirm.

Press `a` to bypass the registry entirely and see every port currently
listening on the machine, whether known to tailport or not — useful for
finding something new to serve, label, or favorite.

## Configuration

On first run, tailport writes a registry seeded with `:22` (SSH) locked to:

```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tailport/config.yaml
```

or, if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isn't set, `~/.config/tailport/config.yaml`. It
won't overwrite an existing file. This is the port registry described
above — labels, favorites, and locks, keyed by port number — and it's
rewritten automatically every time you toggle, label, favorite/unfavorite, or
lock a port from within the app. You generally shouldn't need to hand-edit
it, but the format is plain YAML if you want to:

```yaml
ports:
    22:
        locked: true
    3000:
        label: dev server
        favorite: true
    9000: {}
```

An entry can have a `label`, be marked `favorite`, and/or be `locked` (a
locked port can't be served until you unlock it — `:22` ships locked by
default). An empty entry (`{}`, as for `9000` above) means "keep this in the
default view" without any of those — the state left behind by serving a port
without labeling or favoriting it. tailport also records a `last_process` key
per port automatically (the name it last saw listening, used for the
`was <name>` display); you don't set that by hand.

### Status markers

A top-level `markers` key (or the equivalent `--markers` flag, which wins
over the config value for that run only) selects how a port's exposure-state
marker is drawn:

```yaml
markers: "" # "" / mono (default) | auto | emoji | ascii
```

- unset (`""`, the default) — mono: ○ localhost · ◔ local network ·
  ◑ on tailnet · ◉ served · ● public (funnel) · ▲ stale (dangling forward) ·
  ✕ offline.
- `auto` — opts into detecting a UTF-8-capable terminal (locale is UTF-8 and
  `TERM` isn't the bare Linux console or `dumb`) and switches to the
  moon-phase emoji ramp there, otherwise falls back to mono: 🌕 localhost ·
  🌔 local network · 🌓 on tailnet · 🌒 served · 🌑 public (funnel) ·
  🌫️ stale · ✕ offline.
- `emoji` — always the moon-phase ramp above, regardless of terminal.
- `ascii` — always mono, regardless of terminal (same glyphs as unset).

This setting governs the exposure markers only. Any other emoji/animation
tailport might render (e.g. from its hidden Easter-egg overlay) always
auto-detects terminal capability on its own, independent of `markers`.

### Theme (light/dark terminals)

tailport auto-detects your terminal's background and picks legible colors
either way. If detection guesses wrong (common over SSH/tmux/some
multiplexers), override it with a top-level `theme` key:

```yaml
theme: auto # auto (default) | light | dark
```

or the equivalent `--theme` flag (`--theme light`, `--theme dark`,
`--theme auto`), which wins over the config value. `auto` detects the
background itself; when it can't tell at all, it falls back to `dark` --
existing dark-terminal setups see no change either way.

### Publish (Caddy edge)

A `caddy` block configures the optional publish-to-the-internet path (see
[Publishing to the public internet](#publishing-to-the-public-internet-caddy-edge)
below). Unlike the port registry, tailport writes this block in full — with
visible defaults and explanatory comments — the first time it saves the config
once the feature is present, so the available knobs are discoverable without
reading docs:

> **Upgraded from an older tailport?** A `config.yaml` written before this
> feature landed has **no `caddy:` block yet** — that's expected, and it's why
> you won't find a `domain:` line to edit. It appears on the next save — any
> change that writes the file, e.g. favouriting or labelling a port — or just
> paste the block below in by hand and set `domain:` there. (Publishing can
> also be the trigger: pressing `p` with a blank `domain` captures it inline
> and saves it for you, rather than refusing.)

```yaml
caddy:
    # Tailnet name of the Caddy edge node; tailport reaches its admin API
    # here. Use the short MagicDNS label, not an FQDN.
    hostname: caddy

    # Public base domain used to build publish hostnames. Point its DNS
    # (typically a wildcard) at the public Caddy edge before publishing.
    domain: ""

    # Name of the shared Caddy JSON HTTP server under apps.http.servers.
    # Every tailport computer publishing through this same Caddy edge must
    # use the same value; this does not identify the source computer.
    server_name: tailport

    # Port of the Caddy admin API on the edge (reachable tailnet-only).
    admin_port: 2019

    # Skip the y/n confirm when re-publishing a port already published
    # earlier this session (remembered hostname + auth). First publish
    # always confirms. Default false (confirm shown).
    silent_republish: false
```

- **`hostname`** (default `caddy`) — the edge's own private tailnet
  identity, used only so tailport can find its admin API at
  `http://<hostname>:<admin_port>`. Use the short MagicDNS label, **not** an
  FQDN — the edge admits only its short name, so an FQDN silently 403s and
  publishing rejects one. It has nothing to do with any published route's
  public hostname (e.g. `app.example.com`) — private edge identity and public
  route identity are deliberately separate.
- **`domain`** (default `""`, blank) — the public base domain publish
  hostnames are built from. Blank doesn't block publishing: pressing `p`
  captures the domain inline and saves it before continuing (rather than
  refusing), and until it's set the background published-state poll doesn't
  run (zero cost until you set it).
- **`server_name`** (default `tailport`) — the shared Caddy HTTP server
  tailport manages. Every tailport computer publishing through the same
  edge must agree on this value; it selects the routes array, it does not
  identify the source computer.
- **`admin_port`** (default `2019`) — the Caddy admin API's port on the
  edge.
- **`auth_user`** / **`auth_hash`** — unset (no auth) until you opt into
  basic auth at a publish confirmation. `auth_hash` is always a bcrypt hash
  of the password you typed then, never the plaintext; every published
  route that opts into auth shares this one credential — it isn't
  per-hostname.
- **`silent_republish`** (default `false`) — skips the `p` key's y/n confirm
  when RE-publishing a port that was already published earlier in the SAME
  session (its hostname and auth are remembered in memory only; see
  [Publish is a toggle](#publish-is-a-toggle-p) below). A port's first
  publish this session always confirms regardless of this setting, and
  Funnel's confirm is unaffected. Off by default: the confirm is shown
  unless you explicitly opt in.

None of this configures the edge itself — it only tells tailport where an
**already-deployed** edge lives. Standing up the edge (on Fly.io or any host
you run — Tailscale ACL and auth key, DNS) is a separate one-time operator
task; see [`docs/caddy-edge.md`](docs/caddy-edge.md).

## How it works

- Port discovery: `ss -H -t -l -n -p` on Linux, `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n
  -P` on macOS, run locally — tailport never scans the network.
- Serve status: `tailscale serve status --json`, parsed to find which ports
  currently have an active HTTP mapping.
- Toggling on: `tailscale serve --bg --http=<port> <port>`.
- Toggling off: `tailscale serve --http=<port> off` (a surgical removal of
  just that one mapping; other active mappings are left alone).
- Registry writes: the config file is rewritten immediately after every
  toggle, label, or favorite/unfavorite — there's no in-memory-only state
  to lose if tailport is killed rather than quit normally.

tailport has no dependencies beyond the `tailscale` CLI and the OS tools
above — no daemon, no config beyond the YAML file, and nothing is installed
or modified system-wide other than the `serve` mappings you toggle
yourself.

## Publishing to the public internet (Caddy edge)

Tailnet `serve` and Funnel aren't the only way out to the world: tailport can
also publish a port to a **custom public hostname** —
`https://app.example.com`, no port in the URL, no `*.ts.net` — through a
Caddy edge node you run yourself (on Fly.io, or any host that meets the
requirements; see below). This is a third
exposure level, architecturally independent of both `serve` (tailnet) and
Funnel: Tailscale's role in this path is private WireGuard transport from
the edge to your machine only, and nothing more — Caddy owns the entire
public trust plane (custom-domain DNS, `:443` ingress, TLS termination and
certificate issuance/renewal, hostname routing). No Funnel slots, Funnel
commands, or Tailscale-managed public TLS participate in a publish.

Publishing and Funnel are **mutually exclusive per port**: tailport refuses
to publish a currently-funnelled port (and refuses to funnel a
currently-published one), naming the conflicting exposure and asking you to
remove it first. There is no "publish outranks funnel" — normal use never
needs to rank them, and dual exposure created outside tailport (a foreign
tool, or a manual edit) is surfaced as an explicit conflict rather than
silently picked for you.

**Setup is a separate, one-time operator task**, not something tailport
does for you: a Caddy edge deployed and reachable on your tailnet, a
domain whose DNS points at it, and a Tailscale auth key for the edge itself.
See [`docs/caddy-edge.md`](docs/caddy-edge.md) for the full runbook (written
for a Caddy/Fly first-timer) and the `caddy.*` fields under
[Configuration](#configuration) above for what tailport needs once that edge
exists. Until `caddy.domain` is set, the background published-state poll
stays off; the first time you press `p`, tailport captures the domain inline
and saves it before continuing, so you don't have to edit the config by hand.

Once configured, publishing a port works the same shape as Funnel: select a
port, confirm the public hostname and (optionally) a shared basic-auth
credential, and confirm again against the exact `https://` URL before
anything goes live — the same funnel-grade guardrails (`:22` hard-blocked,
public exposure never automatic) apply here too.

### Publish is a toggle (`p`)

`p` behaves differently depending on the port's state:

- **Already published** — `p` unpublishes immediately. No confirm: reducing
  exposure is never gated.
- **Published earlier this SESSION, then unpublished** — tailport remembers
  that port's hostname and auth in memory (never written to config; the edge
  stays the source of truth) for as long as the process runs. Pressing `p`
  again re-publishes with that remembered config, skipping the hostname/auth
  setup prompts entirely — straight to the same y/n confirm naming the exact
  `https://<hostname>`, unless you've set `silent_republish: true` (see
  [Configuration](#configuration) above), in which case it re-publishes with
  no confirm at all.
- **Never published this session** — `p` runs the full setup: hostname,
  optional basic auth, then the confirm. This always happens on a port's
  first publish, regardless of `silent_republish`.

Press **`e`** to change a published port's hostname or auth **without**
unpublishing it first: `e` always runs the full setup flow (prefilled with
the port's current/remembered hostname when known), ending in the same y/n
confirm `p` uses. Confirming replaces the live route with the new
hostname/auth in place — the port is never briefly unpublished in between.

## Troubleshooting

### Dangling forward (`▲` / `🪹`, "bound to tailnet, but stale")

A row marked `▲` / `🪹` — whose description reads *"bound to tailnet, but
stale — space to unbind"* — means the `serve` mapping is up but no local
process holds the port. Two common cases:

- **The app just isn't running** (it died, or hasn't started). Start it, or
  unbind the port — `space` on the row, or `C` to clear all stale forwards.
  The mapping deliberately outlives the app so you can restart it freely, so
  tailport won't tear it down for you.
- **The app can't start with "address already in use."** When you serve
  `:8025`, tailscaled binds your **tailnet IP** on `:8025`. If your app then
  tries to bind `0.0.0.0:8025` (all interfaces), that collides and the app
  fails to start — so the forward dangles. The mapping meant to serve the app
  is what's blocking it.

  The fix is to bind the app to **loopback**, which is what `serve` proxies to
  anyway:

  ```sh
  mailpit --listen 127.0.0.1:8025      # e.g. — bind 127.0.0.1, not 0.0.0.0
  ```

  This both resolves the collision and keeps the app off your LAN — it's
  reachable only over the tailnet, through `serve`. If you genuinely need the
  app on `0.0.0.0:<port>`, unbind the port first (`space`, or `C`) — note
  that once it's bound to `0.0.0.0`, it's already reachable on the tailnet
  on its own (state `on tailnet`), so there's no longer anything to serve.

## Development

Build and test locally with the standard Go toolchain:

```sh
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```

### CI and the macOS `lsof` path

Port discovery is OS-specific: Linux uses `ss`, macOS uses `lsof` (see
[How it works](#how-it-works)). The default CI runs on Linux, so the macOS
`lsof` code path in `internal/portscan` is built when cross-compiling but is
**not executed** there.

To keep pricey macOS runner minutes opt-in, the macOS-specific tests run on a
native Apple-Silicon runner only when you ask for them, via
[`darwin-tests.yml`](.github/workflows/darwin-tests.yml):

- **Include `[ci darwin]` in a commit message** and push — the macOS job runs
  `go build/vet/test` on `macos-14`, so the darwin-tagged tests in
  `internal/portscan` (the `parseLsof` fixtures and the real-`lsof` `List()`
  smoke test) actually execute.
- Or trigger it manually from the repository's **Actions** tab
  (`workflow_dispatch`).

A push **without** the `[ci darwin]` token does not start the macOS job. The
token is read from the pushed commit message, so use a branch push or manual
dispatch (it is not evaluated for pull-request events).
