**Instructions guide. Hooks enforce. Runtime decides.**

`ClauDEX` is version 5.0 of `claude-ctrl`: a deterministic control plane for
Claude Code. It turns prompt-level operating principles into runtime-checked
workflow, policy, dispatch, review, and landing behavior.

The thesis is unchanged: an instruction that lives only in model context is not a constraint. ClauDEX keeps prompts as intent, uses hooks as the enforcement surface, and moves operational truth into a typed runtime.

This repository is a Claude Code config, a policy runtime, and a self-hosting agent-governance experiment. Its purpose is simple: make the correct path automatic, make unsafe paths mechanically difficult, and make ambiguous state impossible to ignore.

Telling a model to 'never commit on main' works... until context pressure erases the rule. After compaction, under heavy cognitive load, after 40 minutes of deep implementation, the constraints that live in the model's context aren't constraints. At best, they're suggestions. Most of the time, they're prayers.

LLMs are not deterministic systems with probabilistic quirks. They are
**probabilistic systems** — and the only way to harness them into producing
reliably good outcomes is through deterministic, event-based enforcement.
Wiring a hook that fires before every bash command and mechanically denies
commits on main works regardless of what the model remembers or forgets or
decides to prioritize. Cybernetics gave us a framework to harness these systems
decades ago. The hook system enforces standards deterministically. The
observatory jots down traces to analyze for each run. That feedback improves
performance and guides how the gates adapt.

Every version teaches me something about how to govern probabilistic systems,
and those lessons feed into the next iteration. The end-state goal is an
instantiation of what I call **Self-Evaluating Self-Adaptive Programs
(SESAPs)**: probabilistic systems constrained to deterministically produce a
range of desired outcomes.

Most AI coding harnesses today rely entirely on prompt-level guidance for constraints. So far, Claude Code has the more comprehensive event-based hooks support that serves as the mechanical layer that makes deterministic governance possible. Without it, every session is a bet against context pressure. This project is meant to address the disturbing gap between developers at the frontier and the majority of token junkies vibing at the roulette wheel hoping for a payday.

I've never been much of a gambler myself.

ClauDEX is intended to live at `~/.claude`:

```
git clone https://github.com/juanandresgs/claude-ctrl.git ~/.claude
bash ~/.claude/install.sh
```
For replacement installs, run `install.sh` from another copy of the repo with
`TARGET="$HOME/.claude"`. The installer backs up the existing tree, replaces it,
carries forward only `~/.claude/.env`, and wires `cc-policy` onto your shell path
when possible.

Dependencies are intentionally ordinary: `git`, `python3`, `node`, `jq`, and,
of course, Claude Code.

Optional provider keys for Codex review and deep research live in
`~/.claude/.env`; start from `.env.example`.

v5.0 `ClauDEX` moves those policies into a typed Python runtime backed by
SQLite. Hooks normalize Claude Code events and ask the runtime for a decision.
The runtime resolves current state, evaluates policy, records transitions, and
returns the hook-shaped response Claude Code expects.

Deterministic enforcement remains the point, but the system now has a single place where operational truth lives. No more outdated flatfiles. Code reviews are now enforced to convergence using a separate read-only Codex/Gemini CLI critic with execution proof, to avoid model bias. Policies are now abstracted away from the hooks themselves, paving the way for support on other coding harnesses in future versions.

Additional architectural changes:

- shell hooks are no longer the policy model; they are adapters into
`cc-policy`
- SQLite runtime state replaces scattered operational breadcrumbs as the workflow authority
- role permissions are capability-based instead of repeated role-name folklore
- Guardian is split into provisioning and landing authority
- Implementer runs are supplemented by a second read-only CLI critique, Codex
- Reviewer replaces Tester as the readiness authority
- Agent worktree isolation is denied; Guardian provisions controlled worktrees
- dispatch is driven by structured completion records and the stage registry
- routine landing is automatic after reviewer, test, scope, and lease gates pass
- explicit user approval is reserved for real boundaries such as destructive recovery, history rewrite, ambiguous publish targets, or non-straightforward git operations

The result should feel stricter and more autonomous at the same time: fewer unsafe shortcuts, fewer unnecessary user bounces.

ClauDEX runs the current workflow as:

```
planner -> guardian(provision) -> (implementer <-> codex critique) -> reviewer -> guardian(land)
       ^                            |_< loop to convergence >_|                      |
       |                                                                             v
       +------------------------- post-landing continuation -------------------------+
```
```

```
    The role split is intentional. ClauDEX insists on single authorities with shared requirements:

- Planner owns requirements, scope, contracts, and continuation.
- Guardian provisions worktrees before implementation and lands git changes after review.
- Implementer writes source inside the leased scope.
- Codex CLI critiques the work and kicks it back for fixes until it converges.
- Reviewer is the technical readiness authority and is mechanically read-only.
- The orchestrator coordinates the chain; it does not bypass role ownership.

ClauDEX enforces behavior at the event boundary, then stores durable facts in the runtime.

    The policy engine uses first-deny-wins evaluation. The important property is not the current count of policies; that will change. The important property is where the decision is made:

- write and edit decisions pass through the runtime before source changes land
- bash commands pass through command-intent classification and policy evaluation before execution
- Agent launches must carry the canonical ClauDEX contract
- canonical subagent seats are backed by runtime carrier rows, leases, and prompt packs
- Codex/Gemini critic review is hook-wired through `settings.json`,`hooks/implementer-critic.sh`, and`sidecars/codex-review/`
- completion records drive dispatch rather than pane text or local memory
- routine Guardian landing requires reviewer readiness, test evidence, scope compliance, and lease authority
- destructive or ambiguous operations still require explicit user approval

For the live policy list, run:

`bin/cc-policy policy list`For hook wiring drift, run:

```
bin/cc-policy hook validate-settings
bin/cc-policy hook doc-check
```
The runtime is the system of record for workflow facts that prompts and shell scripts are too fragile to own.

Today, that includes:

- workflow bindings and work-item state
- scope manifests and evaluation contracts
- active leases for role and git authority
- test state and reviewer readiness
- completion records and reviewer findings
- one-shot approvals for high-risk operations
- pending agent requests and dispatch attempts
- stage transitions and role capability contracts
- prompt-pack layers delivered to canonical subagents
- hook wiring validation against the runtime manifest
