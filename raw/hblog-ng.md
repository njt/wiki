```
A knowledge-graph blog that turns an Obsidian vault of
Markdown notes into a statically-generated site with an interactive,
canvas-rendered graph of notes and their `[[wikilinks]]`.

Built with Next.js (App Router, static export) and deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

Requires Node.js 20+ and npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/halit/hblog-ng.git
cd hblog-ng
npm install
npm run dev
```
With no vault configured, `npm run dev` renders the bundled
`example-vault/` so you can see what the project looks like
immediately. Point it at your own content by setting `VAULT_PATH` (see
Content below).

The graph and search indexes are generated at build time from the vault. The dev
server re-runs the data pipeline when vault content changes; if something looks
stale, run `npm run prepare-data`.

- `[[wikilinks]]`,- `[[Page#Section|Label]]`, and- `![[embeds]]`resolve to real links and graph edges, with a hover preview card for each target note.
- Obsidian callouts (`> [!WARNING]`,`> [!INFO]`) with themed icons.
- KaTeX math (`$inline$`and`$$block$$`), Mermaid diagrams, and charts (````chart`blocks rendered with Recharts: bar, line, area, pie).
- Syntax highlighting (Prism, One Dark), task lists, and footnotes.
- BibTeX citations: add a `references.bib`to the vault and cite with`[ref:key]`. References render as numbered footnotes.
- Embedded media: asciinema casts (`[asciinema:id]`), YouTube, Vimeo, or direct video (`[video:url]`), file attachments (`[file:path]`), image galleries, and click-to-zoom images.
- `#hashtags`become keyword pages, and- ````query`blocks list notes filtered by type, status, or keyword.

- Knowledge graph rendered on canvas with a D3 force simulation (not SVG),
colored by topic spectrum (offense `#ff0055`, defense`#00e5ff`).
- Drag, zoom and pan, in-graph search, node filtering, and shortest-path finding.
- Client-side fuzzy search (MiniSearch) and a command palette with keyboard
shortcuts (search `Ctrl+F`, graph`Ctrl+G`, palette`Ctrl+K`).
- Per-note table of contents, backlinks, related notes, and suggestions.

- Static export with no server runtime. The site deploys as plain files.
- Raster images are converted to WebP (Sharp, resized to fit 1920×1920) and served with long-lived cache headers.
- Heavy libraries (graph, search, PGP, Mermaid) load on demand.

- Per-note Open Graph images (1200×630 PNG) generated at build time, plus
Twitter `summary_large_image`cards.
- RSS 2.0 (`/feed.xml`), Atom (`/feed.atom`), and JSON Feed (`/feed.json`).
- `sitemap.xml`,- `robots.txt`, a PWA web manifest, and JSON-LD structured data (Article, ScholarlyArticle, SoftwareApplication, breadcrumbs).
- Security and caching headers in `public/_headers`.

- Posts can be PGP-signed and verified in the browser, so readers can check a
note against your public key without leaving the page. Sign with
`npm run sign-posts`; verification uses OpenPGP.js.

The committed `.env` file holds the site's defaults: title, description,
URL, author, and social handles. These `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are public by
design and are inlined into the static build.

To run your own instance, edit `.env` directly, or override individual
values with a git-ignored `.env.local`, which takes precedence and is never
committed. Next.js loads both automatically for `dev` and `build`.

Keep private material such as PGP private keys and passphrases out of `.env`.
Put it in `.env.local` or pass it through the environment at build time.

Content is **not committed to this repo**; it lives in a separate Obsidian
vault of Markdown notes. The build resolves the vault in this order:

- The `VAULT_PATH`environment variable, if set.
- A `vault/`directory in the repo root, if present (e.g. a bind-mounted vault; see`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, which mounts a host folder to`vault/`).
- The bundled `example-vault/`, a small demo vault that ships with the repo so a fresh clone renders out of the box.

To use your own content, point `VAULT_PATH` at your vault:

`VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/vault npm run dev`The `example-vault/` showcases the rendering engine: wikilinks,
callouts, math, Mermaid diagrams, charts, citations, terminal/asciinema casts, and
image galleries. Browse it to see the supported Markdown features.

`npm run build``build` runs `prepare-data` and then `next build` (static export to `out/`). The
data pipeline runs in order:

- `parse-vault`: scans the vault, resolves- `[[wikilinks]]`and related notes, builds the search index, and writes- `data/vault.json`(plus a trimmed- `public/vault.json`for the client).
- `parse-bibtex`: converts the vault's- `references.bib`to- `data/references.json`.
- `optimize-images`: converts images to- **WebP**with Sharp into- `public/images/`(resized to fit 1920×1920).
- `generate-og-images`: renders a 1200×630 Open Graph card per note.
- `copy-static-assets`: copies remaining static files (casts, fonts, PGP keys) into- `public/`.

Generated `data/` and `public/*` artifacts are git-ignored and rebuilt on every build.

Configuration lives in `wrangler.toml`
(`pages_build_output_dir = "out"`).

Deploy from your machine (run `npx wrangler login` once first):

`npm run deploy`Or connect the Git repo in the Cloudflare dashboard with build command
`npm run build`, output directory `out`, and your `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables set
in the project's environment settings. Security and caching headers are served
from `public/_headers`.

| Command | Description | 
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ESLint | 
| `npm run format` | Prettier | 
| `npm run test` | Vitest | 
| `npm run analyze` | Bundle-size visualization | 
| `npm run sign-posts` | PGP-sign vault posts |
